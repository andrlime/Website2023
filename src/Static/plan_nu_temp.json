Today’s workforce is more diverse and companies need to seek greater diversity and inclusion. There are different levels, education, ethnic and generational cohorts in most companies. There are different languages spoken (even in the United States, English may not be the primary language). Employees may be in one location or spread out around the globe, a growing number in virtual offices. Many companies expect to continue to offer greater flexibility after the threat of Covid 19 is over.Reaching employees and communicating with them requires a strategic approach along with a variety of skills. Students will learn how to understand a dynamic employee audience, how to determine what’s important, how to create a workplace environment conducive to mobilizing the employees to act effectively and in concert, how to deal with change in the organization and in the work environment, and how to lead when there’s a great deal of turbulence and uncertainty.Beyond the employees, companies need to be active participants within the communities where they operate. This requires an ability understand strategically which NGOs to reach out and collaborate with, and ways to collaborate to benefit both organizations.

A key part of reaching employees results from effective leadership communications using trusted leaders.The world has changed over the past few years, making the task of aligning, engaging and motivating employees even harder. Today’s workforce is more diverse and companies need to seek greater diversity and inclusion. There are different levels, education, ethnic and generational cohorts in most companies. There are different languages spoken (even in the United States, English may not be the primary language). Employees may be in one location or spread out around the globe, a growing number in virtual offices. Many companies expect to continue to offer greater flexibility after the threat of Covid 19 is over.Reaching employees and communicating with them requires a strategic approach along with a variety of skills. Students will learn how to understand a dynamic employee audience, how to determine what’s important, how to create a workplace environment conducive to mobilizing the employees to act effectively and in concert, how to deal with change in the organization and in the work environment, and how to lead when there’s a great deal of turbulence and uncertainty.Beyond the employees, companies need to be active participants within the communities where they operate. This requires an ability understand strategically which NGOs to reach out and collaborate with, and ways to collaborate to benefit both organizations.

Correlations help to predict outcomes, but if we want to influence outcomes we need to understand causal pathways. It is not sufficient to observe what is happening, we need to know why it is happening. In this course students will learn the toolbox of causal inference econometrics with applications to the economics of health, human capital, and subjective wellbeing. The empirical methods we will cover include multivariate regressions, panel data, difference-indifference designs, instrumental variables, randomized control trials, and regression discontinuities. We will also discuss causal evidence derived from theoretical models and machine learning. Health, human capital, and subjective wellbeing (“happiness”) are core dimensions of social welfare and inequality in our society. They matter as an outcome for people’s lives and they matter as an input into economic and social productivity. Moreover, health, human capital, and happiness are impacted by behaviors and by social and environmental conditions – factors that can be impacted via social policies. To develop effective social policies, however, it is crucial to understand the causal mechanisms driving these factors. We will discuss fetal origins, the impact of air pollution on health, causes and consequences of mental illness in childhood and youth, the impact of income on health, trends in mortality, the economic drivers of fertility, happiness across countries and over time, and the roots of midlife crisis.","p":"ECON 202-0 (Intro to Microeconomics) and a 200-level statistics class (SESP 210-0, STAT 202-0, STAT 210-0 and PSYCH 201-0 are all suitable)"},{"i":"SOC_POL 334-0","n":"Quantitative Tools for Policy Analysis","u":"1.00","r":false,"d":"Hands on analysis of the real time challenges facing a range of policy areas and industries across federal and state governments and the private sector","s":"2"},{"i":"SOC_POL 335-0","n":"Women and American Political Leadership","u":"1.00","r":false,"d":"With women comprising 51% of the American population, yet having significantly lower political representation, we will explore the evolution of women’s political leadership in our nation."},{"i":"SOC_POL 351-0","n":"Special Topics in Social Policy","u":"1.00","r":true,"d":"Advanced work on special topics."},{"i":"SOCIOL 101-6","n":"First-Year Seminar","u":"1.00","r":true},{"i":"SOCIOL 110-0","n":"Introduction to Sociology","u":"1.00","r":false,"d":"Broad overview of a wide range of social issues and ways of sociological thinking.

The course begins with couple of introductory lectures in the biology part (Experimental/Technology part - 2 hours duration - no laboratory) followed by presentations on algorithms and data analysis (Bioinformatics part - 2 hours duration). Finally some recently published articles using these technologies will be discussed.At the end of the course, the students will be expected to gain an overview of the current highthroughput technologies and use of associated bioinformatics algorithms and analytical methods. Students will gain experience in genomic data visualization tools to analyze multi -omics data for gene expression, genome rearrangement, somatic mutations and copy number variation. The course will conclude with analyzing and conducting pathway analysis on the resultant cancer gene lists and integration of clinical data."},{"i":"DGP 493-0","n":"Molecular Basis of Natural History","u":"0.00","r":false,"d":"The molecular basis of natural history course will examine important examples from Nature and use the approaches of biochemistry, molecular biology and genetics to categorize and analyze the natural products produced by bacteria, plants and animals and examine how they have impacted human history.

It does not require programming at all. Instead, students will be using some off-the-shelf AI systems as a way to get experience with cognitive modeling. Ultimately, it useful for every cognitive scientist to have some programming experience, but not for the reason one might think. It is not about writing code per se, but about understanding how to think procedurally. One of the insights that the field of Cognitive Science is founded on is the idea that minds are a kind of computation. So computation is actually one of the languages for expressing theories, not just a means of simulation.
