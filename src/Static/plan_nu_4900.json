The debates, and the topic of opera more generally, attracted some of the era's leading <i>philosophes</i> and other intellectual figures, too, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau (who also tried his hand at opera composition) and Denis Diderot. Further, scholars have shown that the <i>querelles</i> were never just about music: opera was entwined here with key political and philosophical debates of the age. In this course we will study several operas that were heard in Paris in the 18th century and played a role in these <i>querelles</i>, including Rameau's <i>Hippolyte et Aricie</i>, Rousseau's <i>Le devin du village</i>, and the competing versions by Gluck and Piccinni of <i>Iphig&eacute;nie en Tauride</i>, among others.

The debates, and the topic of opera more generally, attracted some of the era's leading <i>philosophes</i> and other intellectual figures, too, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau (who also tried his hand at opera composition) and Denis Diderot. Further, scholars have shown that the <i>querelles</i> were never just about music: opera was entwined here with key political and philosophical debates of the age. In this course we will study several operas that were heard in Paris in the 18th century and played a role in these <i>querelles</i>, including Rameau's <i>Hippolyte et Aricie</i>, Rousseau's <i>Le devin du village</i>, and the competing versions by Gluck and Piccinni of <i>Iphig&eacute;nie en Tauride</i>, among others.

It had, and continues to have, many musical manifestations, including vast repercussions on musical life, not only during the closing years of World War (from the Wansee conference through 1945), but for the following decades through the present day. Some of the overlapping musical issues which we will consider are:\n• Effects of anti-Jewish persecution on musical life generally\n• Musicians as victims of the Holocaust such as those confined to Terezín\n• Musician as survivors of the Holocaust (Anita Lasker-Wallfisch 1925-2020)\n• Musicians, Jewish or not Jewish, who sympathize or identify with victims of persecution and killing\n• Music in the ghettos of Warsaw, Lodz, and other cities of Eastern Europe\n• Music created or performed in concentration camps\n• Music inspired by literary figures (poets, novelists, memoirists) who suffered persecution in the Holocaust: Nelly Sachs, Paul Celan, Elie Wiesel, Primo Levi\n• Music in Terezín/Theresienstadt, the \"artistic\" ghetto set up in the Czech town of Terezín\n• Music created in commemoration of the Holocaust\n• Music associated with non-Jewish victims of Nazi persecution and murder (Sinti, Roma, homosexuals, etc.)\n• Music banned by the Nazis\n• Music approved or promoted by the Nazis during the Holocaust and the years leading up to it\n• \"Aestheticizing the Holocaust\": is it ethical to use it as theme for an artword? Is it wrong to create \"entertainment\" (songs, movies, etc.) out of it?\n• Does the Holocaust force us to re-think European cultural history, including the very considerable musical achievements of German-speaking Europe?\n• Holocaust-related operas (Weinberg's The Passenger, Ullmann's Der Kaiser von Atlantis, Krasa's Brundibar, Rudolf Karel's Three Hairs of the Wise Old Man), Stefan Heucke's The Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz (2006) and oratorios (Ståle Kleiberg's Requiem for the Victims of Nazi Persecution)\n• Holocaust music related to individual victims, including works inspired by the diaries of Anne Frank and their various artistic elaborations: Michael Tilson Thomas, From the Diary of Anne Frank; Oskar Morawetz, From the Diary of Anne Frank, Lukas Foss, Elegy for Anne Frank\n• Holocaust music focused on specific historical episodes and atrocities (Kristallnacht, the destruction of the Warsaw ghetto), also music connecte to episodes with non-Jewish victims such as William Schuman's Symphony #9 \"Le Fosse Ardeatine\" and Bohusalv Martinu's Lidice.\n• The use of music in soundtracks of films on Holocaust themes (Nuit et brouillard, Life is Beautiful, Schindler's List, and many others)"],["Evaluation Method","The principal expectation for all students is the submission of a final research paper approximately 20 pp. in length exclusive of title page and bibliography, double-spaced, in Chicago style.

Undergraduates and graduates alike are welcome, without regard for class standing (freshman-graduate student) or formal musical training. The only requirement for registration is an a priori commitment to sincerely embracing the spirit of the course assignments.

Facility with electronic soundmaking (analog or digital) can be quite advantageous but not absolutely required. Ability to perform vocally or instrumentally is advantageous but can be replaced by electronic soundmaking."],["Learning Objectives","To introduce students to paradigmatic themes (aesthetic attitudes or materials and methods) typically considered to be intrinsic to approaching music composition from an experimental perspective. The course will emphasize the empirical atop a theoretical foundation with the focus on finding new approaches to incorporate into each student's personal praxis. Experimentation necessarily involves thoughtfulness, and this is true regardless of whether it is scientific experimentation or artistic experimentation. Concomitantly, philosophical dimensions come into play, which means that the course will take this opportunity to address the three major branches of philosophy—ontology, phenomenology, epistemology—via our exploration of sound. I want to underscore that in no way could this be considered thoroughgoing or comprehensive, as philosophers have devoted entire lifetimes to pursuing the threads of just a single one of those branches, and we are only going to have ten weeks. Moreover, there will be a bias towards emphasizing the stream of philosophical inquiry that is being referred to as speculative realism or object oriented ontology (OOO)."],["Teaching Method","The course is divided into five Thematic Units, with each unit spanning two weeks. Each unit has an associated project, which centers on a particular focal point. All projects carry equal weight towards the final grade, including the fifth project, which has a quasi-cumulative aspect to it, but is nonetheless weighted the same as the other four. There are four assigned essays for which each class member is responsible to have read and to have posted a written response to that essay. The written response should take the form of selecting a quotation from that reading that the student either resonates with, or that they find problematic: in 1-2 paragraphs, articulate what it is about the writer's position that you admire or consider deserving of critique."],["Evaluation Method","The course is taught as a weekly seminar. All students in the course are expected to do the assigned reading, listening and score study in advance of the subsequent class meeting. As described above, there will be five composition projects, each with equal weight towards the cumulative grade for the class, and each with specific parameters and goals, detailed within the project descriptions. Grading will be P/NP, and as such it will be determined by the following factors:\n—\tAttendance Regular weekly attendance is mandatory; unexcused absences will lower your grade. A seminar course of this nature is a participatory enterprise; if a class is missed you are responsible for finding out from a classmate what material was covered.\n—\tTardiness Excessive tardiness will lower your grade; leaving class early will lower your grade. There will be scheduled breaks every 50 minutes, and some class Zoom sessions will not last the entire 3 hours.\n—\tAbility to understand the project\n—\tCommitment to course This means being prepared with appropriate materials and attention in each class, and treating other class members with courtesy and professionalism.\n—\tMeeting assignment deadlines Each assigned project must be completed on time in order for other members of the class to be able to contribute their responses during discussion periods. —\tParticipation in critique You are required to participate verbally in the discussions/critiques. The ability to articulate your responses critically and develop a basic critical vocabulary will be acknowledged in the grading process."],["Class Materials (Required)","Assigned readings will be available as PDFs to be downloaded from Canvas. Additional handouts will be provided as necessary. Students will study directly from scores of the relevant compositions. Some assignments may require notational skills, either on paper (possibly, but not necessarily music staff paper) or via use of a computerized notation program.

In this course we will review the most important theories of rhythm and meter developed in the last forty years and apply them in analysis of common-practice repertoire.

The assessment will include preparation for and participation in the discussions, one presentation and two analytical papers."],["Learning Objectives","By the end of the class the student will be expected to have become familiar with the most important theories of rhythm and meter developed in recent decades and learned how to apply them in analysis of common-practice repertoire."],["Class Materials (Required)","No textbooks required."]]}]},{"i":"024760","c":"MUSIC","t":"Analysis of Popular Music","u":"MUS_THRY","n":"433-0","s":[{"i":"024760-1","r":[{"n":"Daniel T Shanahan"}],"t":"Analysis of Popular Music","u":"MUS_THRY","n":"433-0","s":"1","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["RCMA Lower Level 113"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":5}]},{"i":"003733","c":"MUSIC","t":"Selected Topics in Music Theory","u":"MUS_THRY","n":"435-0","s":[{"i":"003733-1","r":[{"n":"Richard D Ashley","p":"847/491-5720","a":"r-ashley@northwestern.edu","o":"W 10-11 and by appt.","b":"Professor, music theory and cognition program.

Each week, students enrolled in the class will play 2-3 different excerpts for the class, receiving feedback from the professor as well as students in the class. You are welcome to use repertoire lists for upcoming or past professional auditions, the Civic Orchestra of Chicago, the New World Symphony, summer festivals, or graduate school auditions. There should be a mix of styles, composers, and difficulty so that you gather a list of excerpts that reflects what an audition committee would need to hear; excerpts that demonstrate the skills needed by an orchestral flutist/piccolo player. (If performing an excerpt that has previously been learned, please memorize the excerpt as a new way of working on it.) We will hold a mock audition at the end of the quarter.

We will further explore the overarching system of space law - from international law to national legislatures to regulatory frameworks - that has developed over the last half century to gain deeper understanding of the current space commerce environment. We will consider the role of national security and the various U.S. agencies involved in space military and commercial activities and how the two are linked.

The course will lay the foundation for a robust understanding of corporate restructurings through three primary means: lectures; panel discussions; and a mock board exercise. Lectures will focus on the fundamental rights and obligations of debtors, creditors, and other parties in interest in the various types of major chapter 11 cases, providing critical insight into understanding the motivations, strategies, and available tools for chapter 11 participants. Understanding the perspective and alternatives of chapter 11 participants is critical for a corporation's directors and officers, guided by their restructuring professionals, to plan and design the process and substance of a distressed corporate restructuring, whether inside or outside of court. The course will pay particular attention to the unique fiduciary duties of director and officers during various planning and implementation stages of the restructuring process, and how disputes about those duties play themselves out in contemporary chapter 11 mega-cases. The course also will cover financial valuation methods used by stakeholders in evaluating distressed corporations, and how valuation outcomes impact the restructuring formulation process. Panels will bring together key participants from recent major chapter 11 restructurings to offer their real-world insights and perspectives into some of the most current issues in the field, how the debtor planned and designed the process, and whether the outcomes were as originally drawn up on the chalkboard. A mock board exercise (with outside restructuring professionals and principals serving as mock directors) will enable students to simulate the real-world experience of advising a board of a distressed company in considering its restructuring alternatives and how to design a restructuring process that can be implemented in manner that maximizes value for all stakeholders."],["Registration Requirements","A basic bankruptcy course or permission from the professor.

We will see how that has played out in a number of the Agency's decisions, as well as arguments put forth by union and management. In this respect, long-standing labor law concepts are being questioned and legal precedent overruled -- e.g., NLRB and court rulings addressing whether college student athletes, graduate students, Uber and Lyft drivers, and adjunct faculty are eligible for union representation; the legal limitations placed on a company as it seeks to control what its employees view on their company computers; the once-expanding, then contracting, and now-expanding boundaries of protected concerted activity in our ever-changing social media universe. The NLRB also has issued new rules for union elections, which have been the subject of litigation and congressional criticism. Another recent development is the NLRB's focus on employer rules pertaining to social media policies and confidentiality regulations. New forms of worker representation are challenging the law and providing outlets for worker protest, such as fast food, home care and child-care workers in the Fight for $15 campaign that have been striking periodically for higher wages and a union. This campaign has been successful at raising the minimum wage in many states.

The course will explore practical and ethical issues faced by public interest lawyers and the challenges of enforcing legal rights of low-income clients. In addition to the weekly seminar, students spend 12 hours per week in an approved externship with a non-profit public interest organization doing civil legal work. Students work under the supervision of attorneys in these offices and conduct research, write briefs and memoranda, interview clients and witnesses, participate in community education efforts, and assist attorneys in trial preparation and trial. Students secure their own placement in consultation with the faculty member."],["Learning Objectives","Ideally, if you participate fully and actively in the Public Interest Practicum, you will: (1) Expand your knowledge in particular areas of substantive law, including: the particular areas of law covered at your externship (e.g. employment discrimination), the scarcity of legal services for the poor, the range of legal issues faced by low-income persons, important topics such as race and trauma, and issues in professional responsibility; (2) Improve on a variety of skills: legal (depending on placement and including research, writing, analysis, fact gathering, interviewing, identifying causes of action, case strategy, drafting, and oral advocacy and presentation) and other professional skills (including receiving and understanding assignments, figuring out how to prioritize work, time management, meeting deadlines, learning from feedback, and communication with supervisors); (3) Gain a better understanding of yourself (by identifying successes and areas for improvement and starting to develop and apply new strategies through self-reflection in journals, class discussions, and meetings with supervisors and faculty); and (4) Explore and start planning for who you want to be as a lawyer doing what and where."],["Evaluation Method","The final grade will be based on approximately these components and the more detailed descriptions that follow: (1) 20% 1st journal installment; (2) 20% 2nd journal installment; (3) 10% journal on which you do the best; (4) 25% class workshop; and (5) 25% class attendance and participation. You will write reflective journal entries analyzing your work experiences and different class topics and responding to prompts. You will submit your journal two times over the course of the semester. After you hand in the 1st journal installment, I will provide you with feedback to help you improve on your 2nd journal installment. You will give a workshop to the class on a topic of your choosing towards the end of the semester. As part of the workshop, you will present your research on that particular topic in an engaging, interactive way and facilitate a brief discussion. Class attendance and participation will be graded based on efforts, not on whether answers are right or wrong. In addition, successful compliance with the externship requirements and the expectations of your placement supervisor are essential. Although the field placement experience will not be graded directly, I will be in contact with your supervisor during the semester to discuss your work. Failure to comply with the requirements and expectations of your externship may have an impact on your grade. You will get individual feedback and guidance from me on your journals, workshop topic and outline, and anything else that relates to the class through conferences during the semester, and you can meet with me more, as needed."],["Class Materials (Required)","All course materials will be provided on Canvas.

While it lies there, it needs no constitution, no law, no court to save it.\" To be sure, Hand was hopeful that a fierce commitment to liberty - along with a constellation of other critical constitutional values -- did course within the American people, reflecting and cementing the protections provided under law. But if Hand's optimism was (and is) well-placed, it bears asking: How have these constitutional values been forged within American hearts, minds, and culture? How have public conversations, discussions, and debates about the meaning of the United States Constitution unfolded? And what might those exchanges, located in our past, reveal about how Americans view the Constitution's guarantees within their own lives today? This course, focused on American public constitutional discourse, will address these questions. Specifically, we will assess and compare the public persuasion dimensions of an eclectic series of constitutional controversies. Fusing legal history, rhetorical criticism, communication research, political science, and constitutional theory, we will analyze the public arguments advanced by advocates during these episodes, the methods used to do so, and their success or failure with key public audiences. We will also investigate the discursive manner by which Americans - in print and at the podium, and across legislative hearing rooms, law school classrooms, and family living rooms -- have built a constitutional culture, and the degree to which that public culture: (a) informs individual and community expectations regarding freedom, democracy, and equality; (b) reinforces core constitutional precepts of rights, judicial legitimacy, institutional balance, and the rule of law; and (c) reflects, invites, and shapes the exercise of citizenship."],["Learning Objectives","Students will achieve the following learning objectives: (1) understand the dueling public arguments, and key methods of communication, characterizing each case study's public constitutional debate; (2) engage in rhetorical criticism of the major speeches, movements, and arguments comprising these episodes; (3) develop insights into how public appeals recur, change, and adapt across U.S. constitutional history, and how skillful public advocates draw on prior debates to prevail in new ones; (4) assess the manner in which public debates, key texts, social movements, and rhetorical framings reflect and affect public understanding of the Constitution; and (5) develop insights into contemporary constitutional controversies, including elements of effective public advocacy regarding American law."],["Evaluation Method","This course will operate in a part-lecture, part-discussion format. Evaluation will be based 40% on a 15-page final course paper, 25% on a group project focused on a contemporary constitutional controversy, and 35% on class engagement."]]}]},{"i":"006930","c":"LAW","t":"Criminal Law","u":"CRIM","n":"520","s":[{"i":"006930-4","r":[{"n":"Deborah Tuerkheimer","p":"312/503-4864","a":"LM 301"}],"t":"Criminal Law","u":"CRIM","n":"520","s":"4","m":["34"],"x":[{"h":8,"m":50}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":15}],"l":["Rubloff Building 175"],"d":"2023-01-09","e":"2023-04-18","c":"LEC","a":70,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: MSL Students are not eligible to enroll"}]},{"i":"013609","c":"LAW","t":"Historical Legacies: Race, Gender and Criminalization","u":"CRIM","n":"606","s":[{"i":"013609-1","r":[{"n":"Tera Osahene Agyepong"}],"t":"Historical Legacies: Race, Gender and Criminalization","u":"CRIM","n":"606","s":"1","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Levy Mayer 108 - Wigmore"],"d":"2023-01-09","e":"2023-04-18","c":"SEM","a":20,"p":[["Evaluation Method","GRADING\n• Presentation and class participation- 40%\n• Research paper - 40%\n1.

You will learn how to properly use contract concepts such as covenants, conditions, representations and warranties, grants of discretionary authority, and declarations to convey the intentions of the parties. You will learn how to draft clearly and unambiguously in a contemporary style that avoids formal and archaic terms and expressions and is easy for the reader to understand.

The breakout sessions will be taught by the group of adjuncts and they will rotate throughout the semester. Each student will be designated an \"\"A\"\" or a \"\"B\"\" for the purposes of the assignments. You will retain your designation for the entire semester. The exercise for this class will be drawn from the Taylor v Pinnacle Packaging case file. Students designated as \"\"A's\"\" will always represent Taylor.

Continuing advocacy efforts, as opportunities arise, on behalf of an Indigenous Guji community that is suffering devastating effects due to toxic contamination from the Lega Dembi gold mine. 5.

The volume by Burke and Snowe on Property in the Examples and Explanations series (6th ed. 2019) could also be helpful, because of its similar focus on problems and answers, but its coverage does not match what we do in the course."]]}]},{"i":"006943","c":"LAW","t":"Environmental Law","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"610","s":[{"i":"006943-1","r":[{"n":"Michael R Barsa","p":"312/503-7983","a":"Levy Mayer 305"}],"t":"Environmental Law","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"610","s":"1","m":["012"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":25}],"l":["McCormick 195 - Strawn Hall"],"d":"2023-01-09","e":"2023-04-18","c":"LEC","a":70,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: MSL Students are not eligible to enroll"}]},{"i":"006950","c":"LAW","t":"Family Law","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"620","s":[{"i":"006950-1","r":[{"n":"Kimberly A Yuracko","p":"312 503 3466"}],"t":"Family Law","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"620","s":"1","m":["34"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":25}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Rubloff 150 - Aspen Hall"],"d":"2023-01-09","e":"2023-04-18","c":"LEC","a":70,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: MSL Students are not eligible to enroll"}]},{"i":"006944","c":"LAW","t":"Estates and Trusts","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"625","s":[{"i":"006944-1","r":[{"n":"Max M Schanzenbach"}],"t":"Estates and Trusts","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"625","s":"1","m":["34"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":25}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Rubloff Building 140"],"d":"2023-01-09","e":"2023-04-18","c":"LEC","a":70,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: MSL Students are not eligible to enroll"}]},{"i":"019908","c":"LAW","t":"Colloquium: Climate Change","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"645","s":[{"i":"019908-1","r":[{"n":"David A Dana","a":"LM225","o":"TBA"},{"n":"Michael R Barsa","p":"312/503-7983","a":"Levy Mayer 305"}],"t":"Colloquium: Climate Change","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"645","s":"1","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Rubloff Building 339"],"d":"2023-01-09","e":"2023-04-18","c":"SEM","a":20,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: MSL Students are not eligible to enroll"}]},{"i":"006968","c":"LAW","t":"Intellectual Property","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"650","s":[{"i":"006968-1","r":[{"n":"Laura Gabriela Pedraza-Farina"}],"t":"Intellectual Property","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"650","s":"1","m":["012"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":50}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":45}],"l":["Rubloff Building 175"],"d":"2023-01-09","e":"2023-04-18","c":"LEC","a":70,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: MSL Students are not eligible to enroll"}]},{"i":"007009","c":"LAW","t":"Patent Law","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"651","s":[{"i":"007009-1","r":[{"n":"David Schwartz"}],"t":"Patent Law","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"651","s":"1","m":["012"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":25}],"l":["Rubloff Building 140"],"d":"2023-01-09","e":"2023-04-18","c":"LEC","a":70,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: MSL Students are not eligible to enroll"}]},{"i":"006936","c":"LAW","t":"Disability Law","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"658","s":[{"i":"006936-1","r":[{"n":"Jamelia Natasha Morgan"}],"t":"Disability Law","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"658","s":"1","m":["012"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":55}],"y":[{"h":11,"m":50}],"l":["Rubloff Building 180"],"d":"2023-01-09","e":"2023-04-18","c":"LEC","a":70,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: MSL Students are not eligible to enroll"}]},{"i":"021269","c":"LAW","t":"Information Privacy Seminar","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"664","s":[{"i":"021269-SF","r":[{"n":"Cynthia J Cole"}],"t":"Information Privacy Seminar","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"664","s":"SF","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-01-02","e":"2023-03-10","c":"SEM","a":28,"p":[["Overview of class","May 25, 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) goes into effect. US Companies and lawmakers are wildly unprepared, relying on outdated enforcement mechanisms and vows of companies who flout data protection. Global issues of surveillance and propaganda are daily news. Widespread use of AI in decision-making, revenge porn and deepfakes are commonplace. States react quickly, passing legislation which mimics GDPR and lights a fire under technology companies to lobby for Federal legislation to provide a preemption cover. How did we get here? This course will examine the tension between opposing approaches to privacy; how these laws came into being and some of their disparate, intended and unintended consequences. We will have a guest speaker from a Silicon Valley technology company who will discuss how these laws are put into practice in building the technology of tomorrow. By the end of the class you will understand the contours of data privacy in Europe and the US and the factors that have gone into the recent surge of interest in US consumer privacy. You will also have a greater understanding of how companies struggle with the technology they create; its impact on privacy and how they manage it."]]}]},{"i":"023654","c":"LAW","t":"Intellectual-Property Strategy and Business Implications for Companies","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"674","s":[{"i":"023654-SF","r":[{"n":"Thomas Christos Mavrakakis"},{"n":"Christopher Ryan Lubeck"}],"t":"Intellectual-Property Strategy and Business Implications for Companies","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"674","s":"SF","m":["4","4","4","4","4"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0},{"h":16,"m":0},{"h":16,"m":0},{"h":16,"m":0},{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":19,"m":0},{"h":19,"m":0},{"h":19,"m":0},{"h":19,"m":0},{"h":19,"m":0}],"l":["TBA","TBA","TBA","TBA","TBA"],"d":"2023-01-02","e":"2023-03-10","c":"LEC","a":30}]},{"i":"019986","c":"LAW","t":"Health and Human Rights","u":"PPTYTORT","n":"693","s":[{"i":"019986-1","r":[{"n":"Juliet Suzanne Sorensen","p":"312/503-1482","a":"420 E.

The course will investigate historical dimensions of water in Israel and the Middle East, focusing on ancient civilizations and the water infrastructures that are essential tools in aiding the development of water-poor societies. We will use this historical context as a stepping-stone to transition into a more recent history of the Middle East, focusing on the challenges that the nascent state of Israel faced following the influx of millions of immigrants. We will then examine efforts to develop the necessary water resources needed to support the burgeoning population as we as the irrigation projects designed to convert barren desert land into cultivated agriculture. This more recent history will help to set the stage for discussions regarding geopolitical conflicts over land and water that continue to this day. We will evaluate regional climate and water in the context of current and future geopolitical conflicts, reviewing recent advances in water technologies spurred by these limitations as well as the potential development of combined social and technological solutions for long-term water sustainability in Israel and the Middle East. We will end the course with solutions developed in Israel to other water-poor regions. in addition, the course will host a symposium featuring international experts. It will explore how water access and control contributes to trans-boundary politics and how recent advances in Israel water technologies may serve as a model for sustainable water development in other water-poor regions of the world."],["Registration Requirements","Juniors, seniors, and grad students in any school Freshman and sophomores may be able to enroll with a permission number is space is available."],["Learning Objectives","The course will provide an overview of the climatic and geographical limitations on water availability in Israel and the Middle East, discuss ancient and modern societal responses to these limitations and define opportunities for development of sustainable solutions for regional stability and prosperity."],["Evaluation Method","Written progress report and outline for seminar paper: 20% Final Paper: 30% Weekly Position papers: 25% Presentations & Discussion Participation: 25%"],["Class Materials (Required)","None: Reading materials will be distributed through CANVAS"]]},{"i":"004902-26","r":[{"n":"Ludmilla Aristilde","p":"847/491-2999","a":"Tech A316","o":"By Appointment","b":"Dr Aristilde’s areas of expertise are in the combined application of experimental and computational tools in chemistry and biochemistry to gain novel molecular insights underlying the dynamics of organics in environmental processes. The goal of the Aristilde Group is to obtain a fundamental understanding of the “why” and “how” of the environmental behavior of organics, with implications for nutrient cycling, ecosystem health, agricultural productivity, and environmental biotechnology. Her group seeks to figure out the mechanisms responsible for the physical and biological fates. The current research activities of her group are focused on (i) cellular carbon metabolism of organic substrates in environmental bacteria, (ii) catalytic dynamics of nutrient-cycling extracellular enzymes, (iii) the physical chemistry of biomolecules and organic contaminants in environmental matrices, (iv) molecular ecotoxicological targets of organic contaminants."}],"t":"Special Topics in Civil and Environmental Engrg","k":"Practicum in Environmental Engineering","u":"CIV_ENV","n":"395-0","s":"26","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute M120"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":25,"p":[["Overview of class","This course will focus on the application of environmental engineering fundamentals to evaluate, model, and develop engineering solutions for different environmental contamination scenarios.

We are going to design things that are disruptive and imaginative in an effort to create the future, and in order to do so, we have to be able to help others see what we see. We will explore the process of generative ideation as fueled by design sketching as well as presentation methods for communicating design concepts effectively. We will focus on user experience, human emotion, form and the use of materials in design and develop multiple concepts across a range of industries. We will also imagine and develop ideas at a range of scales, from handheld products, to large architectural installations. We will also work to develop your unique sketching style and aesthetic. We will work in a studio culture involving a fast-paced work environment, peer-review, and an opportunity to learn from a wide variety of resources.

Ecological considerations such as global warming and air pollution impose ever more stringent environmental constraints on power generation and propulsion systems. This course concerns the applications of the laws of classical thermodynamics to the analysis of performance and efficiency of engineering systems such as Rankine, Otto, Diesel, Brayton, Ericcson, and Stirling cycles.

The seminar course is required for all ME PhD students. What it's about This course meets once per week, and each session is run by different faculty members in an innovative forum to address the syllabus topics. The purpose is to expose students to a variety of skills necessary to advance as a researcher during and after their PhD studies. The topics of teaching and technical writing and presentation are incredibly important in a student's future success and yet are seldom taught in a systematic fashion in standard PhD curricula. This course addresses this need by tackling these topics drawing on the expertise of our own faculty. The course is about 1/2 seminar and 1/2 interactive discussion. Some sessions are run as panel discussions and in several areas students will actively participate and be provided feedback on their performance by the faculty. Areas for student activity include preparation and presentation of a short mini-lecture on a research topic, and writing a proposal for a research or teaching lab need.

Companies need to engage and persuade employees to be brand ambassadors with customers, the community where they work and among fellow employees. A key part of reaching employees results from effective leadership communications using trusted leaders. The world has changed over the past few years, making the task of aligning, engaging and motivating employees even harder. Today's workforce is more diverse and companies need to seek greater diversity and inclusion. There are different levels, education, ethnic and generational cohorts in most companies. There are different languages spoken (even in the United States, English may not be the primary language). Employees may be in one location or spread out around the globe, a growing number in virtual offices. Many companies expect to continue to offer greater flexibility after the threat of Covid 19 is over. Reaching employees and communicating with them requires a strategic approach along with a variety of skills. Students will learn how to understand a dynamic employee audience, how to determine what's important, how to create a workplace environment conducive to mobilizing the employees to act effectively and in concert, how to deal with change in the organization and in the work environment, and how to lead when there's a great deal of turbulence and uncertainty. Beyond the employees, companies need to be active participants within the communities where they operate. This requires an ability understand strategically which NGOs to reach out and collaborate with, and ways to collaborate to benefit both organizations. Often, employees want to participate because they know maintaining healthy communities helps them keep social structures functioning well.

The seminar focuses on how the media cover Native American environmental issues and how that coverage contributes to the formation of public opinion and public policy. The seminar provides the critical tools to analyze current environmental struggles; to understand the controversies within a cultural context; and to make informed decisions about issues that affect us all. The central case study of the seminar will be water and fishing rights for Indigenous Peoples, and how they are part of larger land rights issues. Over the past two decades the issue of tribal sovereignty has become front-page news. From major confrontations over pipelines affecting Tribal Reservations mobilizing Indigenous people and their allies around the world, to battles over whaling rights and mining of tar sands, to sulfide mining adjacent to Tribal Reservations, to disputed land claims in the Northeast and battles in the West over water, fracking, and grazing, the rights of Native governments to exercise their sovereignty remains in the new century at the cultural, political, and legal core of American contemporary history. These and many more issues—air and water quality standards, treaty rights, and land-into-trust—have contributed to tension between Native and non-Native communities, and have become the subject of news reports, in both mainstream and tribal media. The goals of this seminar are to understand how tribal sovereignty and treaty rights inform contemporary environmental issues; to identify source selection, bias, and framing in mainstream and tribal media accounts; to analyze and critique mainstream and tribal media accounts for accuracy and bias; and finally gain intercultural knowledge and competence through a final project that explores the intersection of Native environmental issues and the media."],["Registration Requirements","Sophomore standing"],["Class Materials (Required)","None"]]}]},{"i":"000958","c":"JOUR","t":"Documentary","u":"JOUR","n":"368-0","s":[{"i":"000958-20","r":[{"n":"Brent E Huffman"}],"t":"Documentary","u":"JOUR","n":"368-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["McCormick Foundation Ctr 2131"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LAB","a":16,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: In order to register for this course you must have taken JOUR 301, JOUR 301-1, JOUR 319, JOUR 352, JOUR 384, JOUR 390 (JOURneys: New York City & the), or JOUR 390 (JOURneys: Exploring Asian Amer).","p":[["Overview of class","This course will provide students with a comprehensive overview of HD video production specifically geared toward producing short documentaries that tell human stories.

Tax money meant for the poor is pocketed by the people entrusted to help. In each case, investigative reporting has played an essential role, and over the years, it has proven to be one of the highest forms of journalism: shedding light on wrongdoing and exposing corruption at the highest levels. In this dynamic course grounded in real-time investigative reporting, students will expose a problem of significant national or international importance and chronicle its effects on the lives and livelihoods of those most impacted, particularly those in disenfranchised communities. Throughout the winter and spring quarters, students will take on one critical subject using the tools honed by investigative reporters: documents, data and sources. Students will dig deep and learn on the go, reporting on a complicated topic, synthesizing findings and writing or producing a compelling, long-form investigative story suitable for publication. In the past six months, students at the Medill Investigative Lab have published more than 15 stories in The Washington Post, focused on the impact of COVID-19 in America's nursing homes. The stories have prompted calls for investigations by members of Congress. The winter course is a primer: Working remotely, students will devote a tremendous amount of time digging for information and framing stories. In the spring, students will report out stories on the ground, traveling when necessary and if possible. This course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students; students will work as a team and with the professor to report, write and produce stories.

Central to such questions is the place of resistance and its relationship to violence. What are the different ways to resist violence? What does it mean to struggle for self-determination? When does a freedom fighter become terrorist? What forms of resistance might give hope for social change? And should resistance be violent or non-violent? Circulating through these questions is a fundamental concern with power. Thus, this course will be concerned with power as a concept that animates violence and resistance.

On the one hand, it has given news professionals an unprecedented capacity to engage in meaningful conversation with their audiences, which provides them with valuable insight to better understand the public, their preferences and their news consumption patterns. On the other hand, social media has enabled journalists to tell stories across a wider range of platforms, personalising their news offering, and reaching different demographics. Social Media has also come with challenges. Twitter, Facebook and news aggregators, such as Google and Apple News, are now users' preferred news providers, even if the content is produced in mainstream media organisations such as the NYT or the BBC. This trend has seen advertising revenue shifting from mainstream media to online outlets, and from legacy organisations to social media platforms.With these developments in mind, this practical course introduces students to the use of social media for news gathering, production and dissemination. Through engagement with social media platforms such as TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram, students will learn how to produce news, curate and verify information, engage with audiences and gain followers, do live reporting and social listening, and crowdsource investigations. Finally, this course will also train students to deal with toxic comments online and trolling.</p>"],["Registration Requirements","<ul>\n<li>Prerequisites: None</li>\n<li>Open to juniors and above Journalism majors only; for students going on residency</li> </ul>"]]}]},{"i":"024299","c":"DOHA","t":"Documentary for Journalists","u":"JOUR","n":"326-0","s":[{"i":"024299-70","r":[{"n":"Miriam Berg"}],"t":"Documentary for Journalists","u":"JOUR","n":"326-0","s":"70","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":2,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":3,"m":15}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room 2-201"],"d":"2023-01-08","e":"2023-04-20","c":"LEC","a":16,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for sophomore, juniors, and seniors only.","p":[["Overview of class","<p>This is a hands-on practical documentary video production class that places an emphasis on nonfictional field production.

And yet the \"right to play\" is—according to the United Nations, the International Olympic Committee, and the European Union—a fundamental human right. So it's big stuff—less than war, but more than a game. In this course, sport is considered from various contexts. We do it through weekly monitoring of sports media, documentary films, student research and writing assignments, and class discussion. Our contexts include commerce and industry, domestic and international politics (including war) gender and sex identities, racial and ethnic relations, religion and spirituality, and popular culture from fashion to video games.</p>"],["Registration Requirements","<ul>\n<li>Prerequisites: None</li>\n<li>Open to sophomores and above</li> <li>Open for cross-registration</li>\n<li>Satisfies Media and Politics Minor</li>\n</ul>"]]},{"i":"021991-73","r":[{"n":"Fatima el Issawi"}],"t":"Special Topics","k":"Media & Social Transformation","u":"JOUR","n":"390-0","s":"73","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":6,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":7,"m":45}],"l":["Northwestern Qatar Room 3-203"],"d":"2023-01-08","e":"2023-04-20","c":"LEC","a":22,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for sophomore, juniors, and seniors only.","p":[["Overview of class","<p>In the information society, media's power is asserted and challenged everyday.

How do alternative media contribute to challenging dominant media and political discourses and cultures? What is the relationship between media, journalistic practices, and activism? Can we talk about media for development? The course will cover Issues of race, poverty, gender, inequalities, and the climate crisis.

Digital media texts require approaches which recognize changes in practices of reading, analysis, and interpretation. At the same time, they are connected to historical forms like the bulletin board, the satellite image, and political cartoons in newspapers. This course therefore takes both a historical and semiotic approach to the study of digital media to situate the objects that we engage with daily—hashtags, selfies, search results, image filters, and memes—along a longer history of media forms. In doing so, it grapples with questions of epistemology—how we know what we know—prompted by global changes. By approaching digital artifacts in these ways, it shows how imaginaries of what they are shape our understandings of visibility, sociality, and power.

However, play is an important context in which children, and adults, learn and communicate, and is a topic of rigorous academic study across disciplines. This seminar brings together two threads of study related to the art and science of play. In the first half of the course, they are traced in parallel. The first thread, the art of play, focuses on the history and development of Viola Spolin's foundational and ubiquitous theatre games, and their surprising grounding in the early academic studies of play by Neva Boyd, NU Faculty from 1927-1941, who was an early proponent of the importance of play and its academic study, and Spolin's mentor. The second thread, the science of play, is a look at the child's ontological development of play skills, informed by Piagetian and modern insights, with a focus on how play drives communication development. In the second half of the course, we bring the two threads together, as students collaboratively engage in and reflect on the art and science of Spolin's games. For example, students learn and play the Mirror game, exploring it within the context of the study of acting and performance, as well as how it depends on the brain's mirror neuron system and how parents of Autistic children are taught to match turns with their child's communication."],["Registration Requirements","Enrollment is restricted to SoC undergraduate first year students."],["Learning Objectives","1.To deepen understanding about, and encourage enthusiasm for, research related to diversity. 2.To learn about how scholars from different disciplines examine scientific questions, including the varied methods they use in the process. 3.To engage with scholars from across SoC, including through thoughtful in-class questions and discussion. 4.To consider the many different aspects of the field for communication could be examined and understood and even what cross-disciplinary collaboration might look like."]]},{"i":"024300-2","r":[{"n":"Eric Adrian Patrick","p":"847/491-4229","a":"AMS 214","o":"Mondays 1:00PM-3:00PM, Wednesdays 10:00am-12:00pm"},{"n":"Nathan Walter"}],"t":"SoC First Year Seminar: Interdisciplinary Topics in Communication Arts & Sciences","k":"Strategic Stories","u":"CMN","n":"101-0","s":"2","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":20}],"l":["Frances Searle Building 2378"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"SEM","a":20,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for School of Communication Freshmen & Sophomores only.","p":[["Overview of class","A survey of both visual and rhetorical practices throughout history and culture, with readings from media psychology, visual rhetoric, information design, and narrative theory.

The advent of the Internet has brought along opportunities for positive societal impact, from collective production and sharing of resources to social interaction between physically distanced members of marginalized groups. Yet, the Internet has also proven to have consequences that increasingly affect individuals' opportunities and life outcomes in terms of mental, physical, and social well-being. In this course, we explore how the Internet leads to the (re)production of systemic inequalities and think critically about the roles of various actors involved, such as governments, big tech firms, and end users. Throughout the course, you will learn about, analyze, and discuss key theoretical approaches and conceptual tools at the intersection of social inequality, power, and the Internet. Between in-class discussions and the research paper, you will have plenty of opportunities to apply class concepts to social issues as well as your own experiences. Ultimately, the topic of this course is a medium through which we will learn about consuming and producing academic writing. The essence of this course lies in building writing skills through a combination of lectures, workshops, and individual work cumulating in a long-form research proposal. It is important to note that our starting position will be that so-called \"good writing\" is a fallacy. Instead, authoring a coherent text is hard work that mainly consists of getting ideas onto paper and editing in an iterative fashion. Through the act of workshopping, the community of this class will prove to be vital to pushing all our thinking and writing.

Stories function as microcosms of human existence, conveying understanding of something yet-to-be-experienced by the listener. Much like how children learn from observing their parents, our capacity for imagination can help us to learn from the experiences characters in a story. In this course, we will investigate the mechanisms that give narratives such power through an exploration of the history, research, and practice of storytelling to enact change—also known as entertainment-education (E-E). Using the course material as a launching point, students will develop an original research proposal for an E-E intervention to address a social issue of their choice. This project will evidence your capacity to reflect on your values and select a topic of personal significance, conduct independent research, and produce a thoughtful argument for how you might use storytelling to effect change in the world. During the course, our exploration of entertainment-education will begin with its historical and theoretical origins before turning to real-world illustrations of how it is developed and implemented. We will next take a global perspective, investigating how questions of location, culture, and population influence the design of interventions, before examining the unique ways in which the US media environment can facilitate (or hinder) the implementation of E-E. Additionally, as a junior writing seminar, this course should help you cultivate strong research and writing abilities. To that end, our discussions of content will be paired with scholarly activities designed to improve one's ability to reflect on one's writing, provide and receive feedback, conduct independent research, and synthesize ideas from varied sources, among others. These exercises should not only help you to develop scholarly skills, but build rapport with your fellow students and confidence in your ability to express your thoughts in writing.

What does it have to do with justice? What are we seeking to restore in the first place? How, even on an interpersonal level, can repair really be \"achieved\"? What do we seek to transform, and how? In this course, we answer these questions by reading and discussing the work of artists, writers, researchers, and activists defining alternative justice on their own terms. This includes a great deal of writing by Black abolitionists who have shaped transformative justice as we understand it today. Students develop their own understandings of alternative justice movements by engaging critically with these texts.

What role does the media play in that crisis? Media production depends upon the expenditure of large amounts of energy and natural resources. Media devices contain toxic materials and take part in a culture of obsolescence that sends increasing amounts of \"high tech trash\" to the landfill. Media content has often developed in close connection to advertising, and so has taken part in the creation of an unsustainable consumer culture. Despite marketing rhetoric that characterizes digital technologies as weightless, virtual, and environmentally clean, there are vast energy, resource, and labor costs that undergird the Internet. At the same time, media communication can function to increase awareness about environmental issues, can substitute for other kinds of high-carbon activities like international travel, can foster understanding of the more-than-human world, and can aid in the fight for environmental justice, as well as a host of other social and cultural benefits. How can we make sense of the complicated equation of environmental cost and benefit in media culture? This course will explore intersections of media and environment, considering media about the environment, media in the environment, and media as environment. It will cover a variety of media forms and examine how they shape our perception of the environment and foster environmental action. We will consider topics such as theories of media ecology; definitions of the \"Anthropocene\" epoch; the materiality of media infrastructure; media's role in raising environmental consciousness and promoting environmental justice; advertising and consumer culture; wildlife documentary; ecocritical aesthetics; environmental history; indigenous media; representations of landscape and soundscape; and animals as media performers.

When doing the course's exercises, monologues, and scenes, students explore how to use the body's five primary emotional articulators - the 2 eyes, the 2 hands, and the voice - to express physical and emotional force from a base of grounded relaxation. This relaxation-based grounding of body and mind is meant to yield a pleasurable result: working efficiently - using less muscular and mental effort when we throw ourselves into speaking or singing with conviction.

Essence work also enables all artists to contribute more deeply to the creative process, and to take greater ownership over the production. In addition to a close investigation of Essence Work, students will study the artistic processes and techniques employed by innovative artists like choreographers Twyla Tharp and Pina Bausch. This course is an opportunity to expand your understanding of and experience with non-traditional rehearsal methods and techniques.

You will learn to recognize recurring patterns in your own cognition and that of the people around you, and examine the ways those tendencies can lead people to better or worse courses of action. The class opens with a focus on the work of two research psychologists, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, who developed an important framework for understanding how people reach conclusions and make decisions. Their work shaped, in part, the foundations of the field of behavioral economics. As we move through the quarter, we will draw on this framework to analyze human judgment and organizational decisionmaking in medicine, public health, criminal justice, sports, and social media. We will investigate ways to use insights from research to improve the functioning of organizations, with a goal of making life better for the people that work in them and the people they serve. Importantly, we will also consider the limitations of the cognitivist perspectives of Tversky and Kahneman and will explore embodied and extended views of the mind developed by modern-day researchers. In the final project, working either independently or in a group, you will research an organizational phenomenon and develop a design for change using the theoretical perspectives from the course. Grading is based on quizzes, a midterm, and a final project. The course takes place during the late stages of a global pandemic, during a period of significant social and cultural conflict in the United States and increasing geopolitical instability.

Learning happens in social and cultural practices, be they practices affiliated with cultural communities, academic disciplines, or professional and interest-based domains. Many of these practices are also taking place in online, global and intercultural contexts where people bring diverse experiences to the process of cultural production and learning. This course provides a critical introduction to the social and cultural dimensions of learning, with a particular focus on how language and diverse tools and modes of expression mediate forms of identity, learning experiences, and participation in and transformation of social life. We will engage with ways of conceptualizing and studying the relation of culture, language and identity, interrogate existing borders, binaries and hierarchies, and consider learning in the contexts of demographic diversity, transnational migration, media flows and youth cultures. An important goal of this course is to explore how linguistic and cultural diversity can provide generative resources for learning and education. Traditional schools and classrooms tend to draw from a limited range of resources for learning. This is reflected in the literature and content that are used, and the expectations for how people interact and communicate with each other. Such restricted curriculum contributes to the fact that many students' experiences are being marginalized from schooling, and students' having difficulty identifying with what they are expected to learn (cf. Martinez, Morales & Aldana, 2017). In this class, we will read studies that tackle these issues, which are both social scientific and political issues. We will also consider new ways to think about and design learning environments that draw from and build on a diverse range of knowledge, language and cultural resources for learning - resources that are more reflective of the experiences of our students. Through the class readings, materials and discussions, we will venture into diverse settings across community, school, and new media environments.

In our everyday lives, we learn and work within particular arrangements of people, objects, tools, and information. All of these arrangements have been ‘designed', either explicitly with intention or more unintentionally, evolving over time. We will call these everyday organizations; they allow us to solve problems, achieve our goals, and generally get things done. Except when they don't. In this class, you'll learn to identify and analyze everyday organizations through fieldwork, document what's working and what's not, and learn about creative ways to redesign them. The analysis of existing everyday organizations will draw on theoretical perspectives that go by names such as distributed cognition and actor network theory. These perspectives provide us language for talking about and analyzing everyday organizations that are composed of both humans and \"non-humans\" (i.e., objects, tools, spaces, technologies, and representations). In this literature, a near synonym for what we call everyday organizations is \"socio-technical systems\". The argument of these theoretical perspectives is that we must recognize the inextricability of the \"socio\" and the \"technical\" parts of these systems, how they (humans and non-humans) work together (or don't) to do what they do. Another important aspect of the class is looking critically and creatively at the values that inform existing designs of everyday organizations and the values that are guiding your redesigns of these systems. In existing everyday organizations, these values are often implicit, multiple, and even contradictory, but they are important to consider. Overall, the course readings are varied and interdisciplinary; they include literature from cognitive science, sociology, anthropology, design, and the learning sciences.

All digital tools (i.e. programming/coding, robotics, social media, VR/AR, games, and digital design fabrication) have the potential to be used to help learners develop their own understandings of subject-matter. But technology is not always used in ways that improve experiences of learning and teaching. The lack of realizing this potential is often due to limited views of learning that are embedded in the design and use of new technologies. In this course, we will explore views of learning that can be used to realize the promises and avoid the pitfalls that technological innovations can hold for learning in both informal and formal settings. This course is based on the premise that exploring learning with technology will allow us to deepen our understanding of how to effectively teach with technology. As educators, researchers and designers, we need our understandings of technology and its uses to be connected to the theories of learning that are enacted in our practice whether we make them explicit or not. To this end, we will examine how combinations of cognitive, sociocultural and ecological theories enable us to articulate understandings of learning that will improve our pedagogical practice. We will explore the design of activities using technologies that encourage teachers to recognize and value the multiple pathways that learners travel to make sense of new ideas. These designs also provide opportunities for multiple avenues of research related to learning and teaching. The course is designed to immerse students in the use of technological tools for learning and the design of projects for learning with various technologies. Projects, readings and writing in various genres are intended to help students to reflect on their own learning and the learning of others. Course work is also designed to provide opportunities to try out, analyze and interpret various approaches to teaching with technologies. The goal is to develop perspectives on learning and teaching with technology that enable both pre-service teachers and emerging learning scientists to create learning environments that support learners in coming to understand academic ideas, themselves, and their social/cultural contexts. For example, we will look beyond the popular assumption that coding is a good skill for all children as preparation for future economic expansion and workforce development. We will give greater attention to deeper meanings and purposes of coding. We will consider what computational thinking can be when educators attend to the new ways learners can make sense of ideas and phenomena using computational tools. The kinds of questions that emerge from the work in this class include: How can geometry be explored and understood differently with computational tools as opposed to traditional pedagogical approaches? How can engaging in inquiry using sensing devices help learners to expand their sense of possibility for what they can make, learn and do? How does the cultural context of learning inform how technology can be taken up to support learning? What new purposes and meanings for technology use might young people generate for themselves?"]]}]},{"i":"022542","c":"SESP","t":"Topics in Learning Sciences","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"351-0","s":[{"i":"022542-20","r":[{"n":"Megan Elisabeth Bang"}],"t":"Topics in Learning Sciences","k":"Indigeneity, Race & Place in Education","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"351-0","s":"20","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G02"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":15},{"i":"022542-21","r":[{"n":"Victoria C Chavez"},{"n":"Natalie Melo"}],"t":"Topics in Learning Sciences","k":"Computing, Ethics, and Society","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"351-0","s":"21","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Online"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":15,"p":[["Overview of class","Computing technologies shape our personal, social, and political lives in increasingly complex and consequential ways - providing tremendous benefits (e.g. convenient access to information, connecting to one another across time and space) and harms (e.g. biased decision-making, mass surveillance, disinformation campaigns, and exclusion from critical material opportunities) that are important to examine and understand. At the same time, these technologies are born and shaped by the societies in which they are developed. Thus, grappling with the ethics of technologies (i.e considering the harms and benefits, how and why they were created in the first place, and how and to what ends they are used) is important not only for ultimately creating more moral technologies but a more moral society. Thus, our approach to the ethics of computing technologies requires a multifaceted assessment of their harm and benefit to our individual, cultural, and political lives, and simultaneously a critical examination of the values, ideologies, and contexts through which computing technologies emerge."]]}]},{"i":"011575","c":"SESP","t":"Methods and Epistemologies for the Study of Learning 1","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"404-0","s":[{"i":"011575-20","r":[{"n":"Bruce L Sherin"},{"n":"Reed Stevens"}],"t":"Methods and Epistemologies for the Study of Learning 1","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"404-0","s":"20","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Annenberg Hall 101"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"SEM","a":12}]},{"i":"022436","c":"SESP","t":"Tangible Interaction Design and Learning","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"413-0","s":[{"i":"022436-20","r":[{"n":"Michael Stephen Horn"}],"t":"Tangible Interaction Design and Learning","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"413-0","s":"20","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G02"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":10}]},{"i":"020389","c":"SESP","t":"Advanced Qualitative Methods","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"416-0","s":[{"i":"020389-20","r":[{"n":"Christopher Javon Leatherwood"}],"t":"Advanced Qualitative Methods","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"416-0","s":"20","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G08"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":10}]},{"i":"000614","c":"SESP","t":"Topics in Learning Sciences","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"451-0","s":[{"i":"000614-21","r":[{"n":"Jeannette A Colyvas"}],"t":"Topics in Learning Sciences","k":"Organizational Institutions & Society","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"451-0","s":"21","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall 317"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is restricted to LRN_SCI Students Only."},{"i":"000614-22","r":[{"n":"Nichole Pinkard"}],"t":"Topics in Learning Sciences","k":"Opportunity Landscaping","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"451-0","s":"22","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall 101"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is restricted to LRN_SCI Students Only."},{"i":"000614-23","r":[{"n":"Megan Elisabeth Bang"}],"t":"Topics in Learning Sciences","k":"Indigeneity, Race & Place in Education","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"451-0","s":"23","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G02"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":20,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is restricted to LRN_SCI Students Only."},{"i":"000614-24","r":[{"n":"Victoria C Chavez"},{"n":"Natalie Melo"}],"t":"Topics in Learning Sciences","k":"Computing, Ethics, and Society","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"451-0","s":"24","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Online"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":3,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is restricted to LRN_SCI Students Only."}]},{"i":"016668","c":"SESP","t":"Constructionism Seminar","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"452-0","s":[{"i":"016668-20","r":[{"n":"Uriel J Wilensky"}],"t":"Constructionism Seminar","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"452-0","s":"20","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall 303"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is restricted to LRN_SCI Students Only."}]},{"i":"020121","c":"SESP","t":"Responsible Conduct of Research Training","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"519-0","s":[{"i":"020121-1","r":[{"n":"Reed Stevens"}],"t":"Responsible Conduct of Research Training","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"519-0","s":"1","m":[null],"x":[null],"y":[null],"l":["TBA"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":50,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is restricted to LRN_SCI Students Only."}]},{"i":"021589","c":"SESP","t":"Education Sciences Research Practicum in the Schools","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"591-0","s":[{"i":"021589-20","r":[{"n":"David H Uttal"}],"t":"Education Sciences Research Practicum in the Schools","u":"LRN_SCI","n":"591-0","s":"20","m":["0"],"x":[{"h":10,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":0}],"l":["Technological Institute L170"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":15}]},{"i":"000809","c":"SESP","t":"Research and Analysis II: Research Methodology and Data Collection","u":"MS_ED","n":"407-0","s":[{"i":"000809-20","r":[{"n":"Melanie Kay Woodward"},{"n":"Kavita K Matsko"}],"t":"Research and Analysis II: Research Methodology and Data Collection","u":"MS_ED","n":"407-0","s":"20","m":["3"],"x":[{"h":18,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":20,"m":50}],"l":["2122 Sheridan Rd Classroom 250"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":65,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for MS_ED Department Majors Only","p":[["Overview of class","The Masters Project sequence is taken during a student's final year in the program, and serves as a capstone experience for the degree.

In this course, writing will serve as the vessel and vehicle for individual reflection, co-discovery, and worldbuilding. Throughout the quarter, we will write to develop our personal and collective voices during writing (and revision) workshops using the frameworks of \"writing as thinking\" and \"poetic sensibility.\" We will intentionally journey through the realms of the personal, the interpersonal, and an emergence into the transpersonal. We will interrogate our relationships to systems of oppression and personal theories of writing while simultaneously deepening our relationships to resistance, healing, and emergence.

of class","Together, we will explore the complex relationship between the emergence, existence, and (often) endurance of pressing social problems (e.g. inequality, discrimination, illness, hunger, poverty, violence) and the creation and implementation of policies meant to address them. Policy can define much of social life. It can determine who receives access to resources and services and who does not; what types of behavior are restricted and punished, and what types are rewarded; and how individual needs are balanced with a (far from consensus-) understanding of the collective, common good. Social policy, in other words, exists in a contested space, and one that shapes opportunities, resource structures, and life outcomes for individuals and communities. In the first part of the course, we will explore the political process by which these important policies are made. We will interrogate why some social problems receive more policy attention than others, how and by whom policy agendas are set, whose voices are listened to, and under what conditions meaningful policy change and transformation occurs. In the second part of the course, we will focus on policy implementation, exploring how policy moves through the regulatory system and is eventually carried out by front-line workers (e.g. teachers, social workers, police officers) who interface with the public. We will investigate how these interactions impact individuals and communities, ultimately shaping what the consequences of policy look like on the ground. Throughout the quarter, students will learn how to frame, write, and present a policy brief on an important social issue. We are excited to learn with you this quarter and to create an engaged, compassionate space for thinking about the most pressing social issues around us today."],["Class Materials (Required)","Eugene Bardach and Eric M.

Some estimates indicate that despite laws declaring trafficking\nillegal, the illicit practice currently victimizes more individuals than the height of the African Slave\nTrade. While policy to enhance anti-trafficking efforts and to improve victim protections has\nrapidly been approved, there are still questions about successful implementation of those policies\nand important questions about elite influence in the development of equitable policies. From a\npolicy perspective, human trafficking is difficult to address because the entire practice is illicit, and\nas a result, hidden. Further, trafficking often victimizes individuals who are already vulnerable\ndue to poverty, immigration status, youth, domestic abuse, and/or drug abuse, which means anti-\ntrafficking policy often overlaps with many other policy spheres including immigration, security,\nenvironmental policy, sex industry policies, and health policy. This class gives an overview of the development of the African slavery in the United States, as a\nwindow into slavery generally and what has and has not changed. In particular, we consider how\nhuman trafficking could rise following the legal emancipation of slaves in the 19th century. We will\nfollow the development of modern anti-trafficking policy as it arose from distinct policy areas for\nsex (the Mann Act) and labor (peonage and indentured law statues) and how these distinctions\nboth inform and limit current policy efforts. We will also investigate the difficult of addressing\ntrafficking, both from a governmental and non-governmental perspective. We will also consider\nhow trafficking varies globally, particularly how differences in policy definitions and institutional\nstructures matter for successful prosecution of trafficking. The class will also discuss the roles of\nthe public and the media in development and limitations of anti-trafficking policy. We will talk\nabout the difficulties in both defining the extent of human trafficking and assessments of current\npolicy. Finally, we will consider how the case of trafficking within the United States fits within a\nglobal endemic, and how national efforts matter to international work."]]}]},{"i":"020038","c":"SESP","t":"Economics of Education Policy","u":"SOC_POL","n":"332-0","s":[{"i":"020038-20","r":[{"n":"Ofer Malamud"}],"t":"Economics of Education Policy","u":"SOC_POL","n":"332-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Annenberg Hall 345"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":35,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Prerequisite: Students must have completed ECON 202 & SESP 210 (or equivalent) to register for this course.","p":[["Overview of class","\"This course explores the central themes in K-12 and higher education from an economic perspective.

Assignments will include literary analysis papers, with options for the second topic that involve film comparisons.

Specifically, Toni Morrison's historical Nobel Prize in Literature (1993), the adaptations of novels by Alice Walker, Toni Cade Bambara, and Zora Neale Hurston into film, and the advent of Oprah Winfrey's book club mark moments where Black women's fiction moved out of the margins of popular reading culture. Moreover, while these works became best known at the end of the twentieth century, there is a much longer literary history attributed to Black women writing very layered, intriguing, and beautifully-written fiction, both short and long. In January 2020, Time said this of Zora Neale Hurston's short fiction, most of which was written in the 1940s: \"Hurston's short fiction is ripe with imagery and narratives that blend the real and the idyllic, the whimsical and the serious, the natural and the cultural.\" Known best for her novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God, Hurston also produced several short stories. This course will explore the long tradition of Black women's fiction, beginning in the nineteenth century and ending in the present moment, primarily through the short story genre. In this class, we will survey a wide range of Anglophone Black Diaspora women authors and primarily concentrate on those from the US. We will interrogate themes, symbols, and forms in short fiction works that extend across the Black Femme/Feminine Literary tradition. We will ask how these authors similarly and differently explore Black feminine identity as it intersects at the juncture of unique social, economic, and sexual contexts. What are the unique issues of Black womanhood that they explore? Of what do they attend, outside of Black womanhood? Our authors will include at least Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Zora Neale Hurston, Toni Morrison, Octavia Butler, and Edwidge Danticat. Assignments will include, at least: regular online discussions, in-class discussion leading, and an individual final project. Students will be evaluated on their performance in these assignments as well as class attendance and participation. This seminar depends on discussion and participation of every member of the class. Come to class ready to enthusiastically address issues of race, gender, class, and sexuality."]]},{"i":"001186-21","r":[{"n":"Isaac Noah Ginsberg Miller"}],"t":"First-Year Seminar","k":"Black Creativity in the Digital Age","u":"AF_AM_ST","n":"101-6","s":"21","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["University Library 3670"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"SEM","a":14,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for First Year & Sophomore only","p":[["Overview of class","New Media Black Aesthetics.

Slavery, colonialism, and the violent production of racial difference in and across these imperial economies formed an African diaspora that resisted these conditions of exploitation and unfreedom. Framing the period as a 400-year war for abolition, we show that Black resistance led by rebels, maroons, and organized people, set into motion a wave of abolitionism that began in the 1780s, ignited Civil War in the U.S., and concluded in the 1880s when Cuba and Brazil outlawed slavery."]],"o":"4"}]},{"i":"001195","c":"WCAS","t":"Introduction to African-American Studies","u":"AF_AM_ST","n":"236-0","s":[{"i":"001195-20","r":[{"n":"Kennetta Hammond Perry"}],"t":"Introduction to African-American Studies","u":"AF_AM_ST","n":"236-0","s":"20","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":9,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":10,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-435"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":30,"p":[["Overview of class","This course will introduce students to the field of African American Studies.

However, of the various populations, groups, communities, ethnicities, nationalities and identities western scholarship in the humanities and social sciences has deemed worthy of legitimate study, it remains the case that whiteness as it shapes and affects both white populations and non-white populations is routinely exempted from analysis. All of which raises the question of how and why this particular white elephant in the nation's room has remained unstudied and understudied for so long, so much so that many white individuals appear to be oblivious to the racial issues of whiteness and their own whiteness, until they encounter people of color. At the same time people of color find so much of their lives involve protracted and difficult encounters and negotiations with institutional and individual forms of racially discriminatory whiteness, that simply cannot be ignored.

Emerging paradigms will be examined, such as the superceding of images by information, and of art exhibition by communication and media platforming. We will consider some of the different ways that artists handle information and new media and technology, for example how they have appropriated relatively new forms like networks and databases. The social and technological changes associated with globalization and the artistic responses to such changes will lead us to track shifts in art's relationship to audiences and culture at large, and to question the relevance today of distinctions between high and low, margin and mainstream. With these developments as our framework, we will then review and update notions of modernism and postmodernism in the visual arts, and question the status today of more traditional media like painting and sculpture, as well as re-evaluate the idea of the avant-garde and its long-held desire to merge art and life.

Characterized by gilt interiors, ornamental curves, and pastel colors, the Rococo infiltrated all forms of art making, from architecture, to painting, sculpture, porcelain, and even fashion. The style was immediately ridiculed for being overtly feminine, frivolous, and excessively luxurious. Associated intimately with the doomed queen of France, Marie Antoinette, the Rococo is often cited as a direct cause of the French Revolution that would take France (and Europe) by storm in 1789. In this course we will study Rococo art, from its origins in the sixteenth century to its fall from popularity circa 1785. By unpacking both the Rococo's bad reputation and socio-political importance, we will explore how the style was both gendered and racialized. How did Rococo art challenge dominant heteronormative aesthetic practices? How did it establish and fetishize a culture of whiteness in direct opposition to a growing colonial plantation system across the Atlantic? Throughout the quarter we will cover a variety of art forms (painting, sculpture, the decorative arts, and architecture) through the lives of key female patrons—including the infamous Marie Antoinette and lesser-known art historical \"influencers\" such as Madame de Pompadour and Madame du Barry.

Some of these revolutions are well-known, such as the French Revolution (1789) and the Russian Revolution (1917); others deserve more attention, such as the Ottoman Constitutional Revolution (1908). At the same time, the nineteenth century witnessed the massive expansion of European imperialism in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, igniting numerous anti-colonial revolutions, including the Haitian Revolution (1791) and the Indian Rebellion (1857). These revolutions posed a direct challenge to \"modern\" Europe and its supposedly liberal values. Moving between these diverse political and cultural contexts, this course investigates art's role in representing revolutionary ideals and producing new kinds of political subjects in the nineteenth century. This course takes a global frame that centers capitalism, interimperial competition, race, and gender as the primary forces that drove revolutionary art-making throughout the world.

Grounded in the Block Museum's exhibition, The Heart's Knowledge: Science and Empathy in the Art of Dario Robleto, the course positions Robleto's creative practice as an entry point into the field of media archaeology. Robleto's inquiries into the histories of medical visualization, sound recording, and 19th-century visual culture will dovetail with readings and course materials that showcase various critical and artistic approaches to scientific media. Combining lectures, discussions, and student presentations, each week will examine a different set of objects and topics, such as maps, magic lantern projectors, silent films, early computer animation, planetariums, and virtual reality.

As the course is conducted at the Art Institute, students will have a unique opportunity to work directly with artworks in the museum's collections, to develop critical skills for visual analysis first-hand, to draw connections between visual culture and spatial theory, and to gain knowledge about museum practices more broadly.

At par with Iberian and the Ottoman empires, the Mughal empire had extended over much of Central and South Asia since its inception in the 16th century. However, South Asia's long 18th century was marked by the rapid decentralization of the late Mughal State, Iranian, and Afghan invasions, and its gradual colonial takeover by the British East India Company in a period seen as a crisis of the Mughal State. In this phase, marked by large-scale migration of artists and literati fleeing the capital Delhi to the regional provinces, only a fledgling group of artists remained who were positioned at the nexus of exchange of power and patronage from the Mughals to the British. The seminar analyzes a new set of politically operative works which sought to recover the spatial, embodied, and performative histories of Mughal rule in a normative colonial sphere. Through themes focusing on cartography, court painting, urbanism, portraiture, ethnography, and souvenirs, this seminar will formulate the preconditions of a paradigmatic ‘spatial and material turn' in 18th century artistic practice that not only upended the Company's provincializing and racializing approaches, but also reformulated the Mughal as de rigueur, recalibrating the parameters of colonial taste and consumption in Anglo-Mughal society."],["Class Materials (Required)","Course readings will be available on Canvas."]]}]},{"i":"019624","c":"WCAS","t":"Topics in Asian American Social and Cultural Analysis","u":"ASIAN_AM","n":"203-0","s":[{"i":"019624-1","r":[{"n":"Helen H Cho"}],"t":"Topics in Asian American Social and Cultural Analysis","k":"Constructing North Korea in the 'Western' Imaginar","u":"ASIAN_AM","n":"203-0","s":"1","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Harris Hall L05"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":20,"p":[["Overview of class","Kim Jong Un bans mullets and skinny jeans.

How do the formal elements of the game experience shape the stories that they tell and the meanings that they convey? What historical contexts make those stories meaningful, and what is the significance of historical shifts in game form? In this class, we answer these questions through a study of the Japanese Role-Playing Game—the JRPG. We approach the JRPG as a genre, under the premises that cultural genres represent the formal crystallization of a set of cultural meanings, that individual works express particular meanings through manipulation of the details of form, that the evolution of form reflects historical shifts in cultural meanings, and that interpretation of an individual work thus demands knowledge of genre conventions, careful attention to the nuances of form, and rich historical contextualization.

These artistic and literary forms were, and remain, one of the primary means through which people in South Asia encountered and understood Islamic thought. Simultaneously artistic and spiritual, entertaining and didactic, these forms of artistic expression appeal to both Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Today, Sufi literature and arts continue to occupy a central place in the artistic universe of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Thirteenth-century devotional appear in synthesized Bollywood love songs meant for popular audiences, pop-anthems quote 16th century savants, while listeners around the world enjoy remixes of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's devotional qawwalis.

Those who may want to explore a career in business should find the seminar helpful in preparing for many types of professions across disciplines. Students will be exposed to topics such as leveraged buyouts, junk bonds, venture capital investing, the \"Internet Bubble\", entrepreneurial management, hedge funds, and derivatives. In addition, we will explore public policy trends around issues including corporate takeovers, technology transfers, risk management, government bailouts and business investment.

interpretations of scientific results have been used to justify racial and gender oppression for centuries. It was often argued that people of different races and different genders were fundamentally different, and as such their roles in society should differ as well. Today, many people reject the claim that race and gender have substantial effect on a person's abilities or capacity, but how did we get here? More importantly, how did science help facilitate these claims in the first place? In this course, we will explore the role of science in historical oppression based on race and gender. We will identify key scientific studies and their subsequent legacy to reveal the precarious nature of scientific interpretation in the hands of biased individuals. We will discuss how power structures can infiltrate scientific integrity and propose safeguards to prevent this kind of infiltration in the future."],["Class Materials (Required)","1.

Still, at the time of the eruption Campania's cities were thoroughly Romanized; they are now famous for the evidence they provide for Roman daily life.

In the mid-15th century, the millennium-old Byzantine empire finally collapsed. Its image, however, not only survived but acquired new facets, disentangled from mundane credibility. It was used or rather misused and abused by the European enlighteners, philosophers, politicians, but most actively by the Russian authorities, from the eighteenth-century Empress Catherine the Great to today's President Vladimir Putin. We will look how Byzantium was depicted in literature, from Russia's greatest poet Alexander Pushkin to contemporary Italian philosopher and novelist Umberto Eco. We will analyze literary, political and mass media texts as well as movies (for instance, the Turkish 2012 film, Fetih) and architecture, including American ones: St. Louis Cathedral in St. Louis, Lakewood Memorial Church in Minneapolis, National Shrine of Immaculate Conception in Washington D.C., etc. Finally, we will deal with the most recent events: the Turkish President Recep Erdogan's decision to reconvert Hagia Sophia Cathedral in Istanbul from a museum to a mosque—and the Moscow ideologues' reconceptualization of the annexed Crimea."],["Class Materials (Required)","Required textbook(s): N/A"]],"o":"467"}]},{"i":"002979","c":"WCAS","t":"Learning, Representation & Reasoning","u":"COG_SCI","n":"211-0","s":[{"i":"002979-20","r":[{"n":"Dedre Gentner"}],"t":"Learning, Representation & Reasoning","u":"COG_SCI","n":"211-0","s":"20","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":20}],"l":["Pancoe Building Abbott Aud"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":100,"p":[["Overview of class","Cognitive Science is the interdisciplinary study of the mind.

It competes with the more traditional notion of \"alienation\" as a categorization of contemporary life, at least in the \"West\" (or if you prefer \"Global North\"). What is explicit in the German word but not in the English is the reference to the \"home\". What however distinguishes the notion of the Unheimlich from previous theories of alienation or estrangement is that the experience no longer can be framed within the mutually exclusive polarity of domestic vs foreign, since the Unheimlich turns out to be most at home in the home, its strangeness reveals itself to be strangely familiar. Formulated in this way, literature emerges as a privileged medium of the Uncanny.\nIn this course, we will retrace its emergence of a theory of the Uncanny in the texts of Freud and Heidegger, each of which reserve a special place for literature as a privileged setting for this \"apparition\": for Freud the story by E. Th. A. Hoffmann, \"The Sandman;\" for Heidegger Sophocles' tragedy, Antigone. If these ¨classical¨ articulations of the uncanny in literature can be understood as a challenge to traditional Western notions of self-identity, we will look at some responses to this challenge in texts as diverse as The Odyssey (books 23 k& 24), Oedipus at Colonus, several shorter \"stories\" by Kafka (\"Cares of a Housefather,\" \"The Silence of the Sirens\") and finally two \"science fiction\" stories adapted for radio: \"Child's Play\" by William Tenn (1948-51) and Robert A.

Histories and Cultures of an Emotion\nEmotions are integral to our lives and influence how we navigate the social worlds we inhabit. This course explores an emotion that is notoriously difficult to characterize-shame-as it manifests itself in literary and visual media in history and contemporary culture. During the quarter, we will explore the concept of shame in contexts ranging from sexuality studies (transsexuality, #MeToo), to Black feminist theory (white supremacy), post/neo-colonial discourses (Truth and Reconciliation Committee in South Africa), Holocaust and postcolonial studies (survivor guilt), and inequity (poverty and class struggle). We will discuss a variety of materials, selected from a variety of literary texts (J.M. Coetzee, Franz Kafka, Nella Larsen, Primo Levi, Thomas Mann), essays (phenomenology, philosophy, psychoanalysis, cultural studies), film (Boys Don't Cry, reality T.V.), and excerpts from political commissions (TRC in South Africa). Topics for discussion may include: How do we \"read for\" emotion/render emotion legible? What role do identity and identification (gender, race, class, religion, and sexuality) play in shame? Does shame differ from guilt (and why should this matter)? Can shame be political and a social force? Does shame have a history? Is shame a social or a private emotion; a bodily or a psychic reaction? We will pose these and other questions and search for answers to them during the course of the quarter.

The range and nature of responses to Fanon's work since his time speaks to the continued problem of colonialism, anti-Blackness, and the racialized gender system, as well as the changes in paradigms and discourse surrounding these issues.

While attention is focused on the concept of aura he developed in \"The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility\" and elsewhere, his broader inquiries into technology are often overlooked. The contemporary relevance of Benjamin's philosophy of technology lies in the fact that Benjamin establishes a connection between technology (Technik) and various forms of habitation (Wohnen), which is itself embedded in the concept of habit (Gewohnheit). The seminar brings Benjamin's understanding of these concepts into dialogue with those developed by Heidegger, Deleuze/Guattari, and Simondon, all of whom associate technology with the shaping of environments and the problem of poesis. By reconstructing Benjamin's philosophical anthropology through a close reading of his diaries and essays, the seminar not only brings his work into dialogue with a series of major twentieth-century thinkers but also invites comparison with the most recent and far-reaching theories of technology today."]]}]},{"i":"018715","c":"WCAS","t":"Studies in Literature & the Disciplines","u":"COMP_LIT","n":"486-0","s":[{"i":"018715-21","r":[{"n":"Harris Matthew Feinsod"}],"t":"Studies in Literature & the Disciplines","u":"COMP_LIT","n":"486-0","s":"21","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 418"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":4,"p":[["Overview of class","Studies in Contemporary Literature: The Blue Humanities\nCourse Description: This course focuses on a recent profusion of criticism in the \"blue humanities,\" which we will define as the cultural study of marine and aqueous environments, especially as these spaces shape discourses of environmentalism and political geography.

This class is being run in coordination with the Departmental seminar series organized around the theme of Dr. Brodsky's past and present research portfolio. Each week we will read a paper or papers by the seminar speaker, discuss that paper together, attend the seminar, and participate in a private Q&A with the speaker after their seminar. Students will be expected to lead paper discussions, turn in written summaries of the papers, and actively participate in both discussion and Q&A. The topics in this class will explore the fundamental physical processes that make rocks weak, ranging from the geodynamics of crustal and lithospheric deformation to the materials science of minerals and crystalline defects. Earth's outermost rocky shell is strong enough to support kilometers-high mountains, preserve billions-year old continents, and hold over a billion cubic kilometers of ocean. However, rocks can be dramatically weakened, for example during brittle failure and fault rupture in earthquakes, fluid infiltration and liquefaction in avalanches, melting and magma production in volcanoes, and microstructural damage and shear localization at tectonic plate boundaries, which govern both human and planetary scale geological processes."],["Registration Requirements","The seminar is open to all graduate students and upper level undergraduates with instructor approval."],["Class Materials (Required)","Readings will be posted on Canvas"]]},{"i":"001948-02","r":[{"n":"Yarrow Larue Axford","a":"Technological Institute F394/F395","o":"axford@northwestern.edu"}],"t":"Advanced Topics","k":"Lake Michigan and Climate Change","u":"EARTH","n":"450-0","s":"02","m":["4"],"x":[{"h":13,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":15,"m":50}],"l":["Technological Institute F391"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"SEM","a":10,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students.","p":[["Overview of class","The overarching goal of this seminar is for participants to develop an evidence-based understanding of diverse ways in which anthropogenic climate change will affect natural systems within and around Lake Michigan.

Great restaurants and violent crime, economic opportunity and political corruption, music festivals and homelessness, cities seem to embody all of the prevailing social divisions and contradictions. In this course, we will think critically about cities by examining how they are represented in fiction and film. What is the city's relationship to the surrounding area? What types of thoughts and behaviors does it seem to call for? What kinds of encounters are typical? In short, what happens when we treat cities more as \"characters\" than \"settings,\" when we think of Las Vegas as a party animal (What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas), or New York as a cultured gadabout (The city that never sleeps), or Detroit as pugnacious and defiant (Detroit vs. everybody)? We will begin with two cities that are sharply defined by internal divisions, those in the television series Derry Girls and the film Blade Runner 2049. From there, we will compare two representations of Las Vegas (The Hangover and Fear and Loathing), and ask what kind of freedom is on offer and what is the cost of such freedom?

This course addresses questions of visibility within the Puerto Rican enclave of New York. We will have the opportunity to discuss movie clips from West Side Story to oral performances of poetry. In Luis Rafael Sánchez's poem \"La guagua aérea,\" the following exchange depicts the relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico: \"Which town in Puerto Rico do you come from? With striking ordinariness…she replied - De Nueva York.\" We can compare these lines to the famous West Side Story song that exclaims, \"Nobody knows in America/Puerto Rico's in America!\" Whether asserting that New York is located in Puerto Rico, or that Puerto Rico is in fact in \"America,\" one thing is certain: the boundary between the United States and Puerto Rico is extremely blurry, malleable and, one may even argue, subjective. Through poetry, memoirs, and short stories, Nuyorican/Puerto Rican literature represents an in-betweenness via references to, and often nostalgia for, the Island. This course will explore the violence and rehabilitation of Down These Mean Streets, the crying out of Nuyorican poetry and the impact of the memoir as a genre. We will consider how interracial dynamics and border theory influence Latinx literature, including Nuyorican slam poetry, and we will analyze how the past affects contemporary literature, which speaks out against stereotypes of poverty, welfare, and social status."],["Evaluation Method","1.\tTheoretical Review (3-4 pages) (15%)\n•\tChoose one text on literary theory (either The Social Imperative or In Visible Movement) •\tHow might we read Down These Mean Streets within the context of the secondary readings that we've discussed thus far?\n•\tIn other words, based on the secondary reading (The Social Imperative / In Visible Movement), how can we apply the ideas of Paula M.L.

Through understanding the umbrella of border literature, via Nuyorican poetry, which includes liminality and mestizaje, one can analyze how in-betweenness is a necessary component of those of mixed race and the poems they write/perform. Furthermore, this in-between stage represents Nuyorican identity in relation to the terms, \"borderland,\" \"liminality\" and \"mestizaje.\" The following poems were selected based on the writers' experiences as Nuyoricans who portray gritty, beautiful, and powerful poems. Individually, each text conveys how liminality and mestizaje operate under the main concept of border literature, a collective term that frames each poem. 2. \"WE WANTED MORE\" (Torres 1). We the Animals, by Justin Torres, emerges with a\ncapitalized communal craving for more, which permeates both the novel and the film. Director\nJeremiah Zagar's 2018 film adaptation illustrates how a pre-teen named Jonah yearns for \"more\"\nvia his desire for transcendence, through sexual liberation specifically. Animal motifs, Spanish,\nand musicality commingle throughout this work, in order to convey how desire and transposition\nfunction from the unique perspective of a queer, ethnoracially mixed child. Through comparisons\nbetween We the Animals, the novel and the film version, this study provides an unconventional reading of protagonists who resist their queer interracialized family dynamics. Along with repeated references to racial mixture, these comparisons reveal a complex understanding of Latinx identity that approximates a queer reading of racialized sexuality."],["Class Materials (Required)","Moya, Paula M.

The first half of the course will emphasize recent case studies of literature adapted into popular movies, tracking how not just the plots and characters but the perspectives, voices, structures, prose styles, and associated politics of written work get preserved but also transformed on screen, in blatant and subtle ways. In the second half, we will reverse course to examine plays, essays, and other literary works inspired by the movies. Cultivating techniques of close analysis—whether breaking down a film sequence, parsing a scholar's arguments, or negotiating between two versions of the \"same\" story—will be the paramount skill developed in the course, hopefully leading to deeper appreciations of several kinds of texts. Lectures, discussion sections, and assignments will presume no prior coursework in film studies, but they will require quick, studious absorption of terms and concepts that might be new.

In this class we will read four women writers in depth, giving us time to delve into the critical literature and discuss the issues that vex their place in the canon. In the twelfth century, the popular romance poet Marie de France (who wrote in French but lived in England) proudly signed her work—because she feared, with good reason, that \"some cleric\" or learned man would claim credit for it. Late medieval England's most important women writers, Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe (who knew each other), were long consigned to a religious ghetto. Kempe in addition was pathologized as a hysterical female. Finally, the prolific French writer Christine de Pizan became the first professional author in Europe—that is, the first of either sex to support herself and her family solely by writing. She was translated into English in the early modern period. Despite her explicit feminism, however, her signed works were often ascribed not to her, but to their male translators.

Comparing modern sexual mores to those of the past, however, Michel Foucault notoriously deems us \"other Victorians\" in our erotic predilections and preoccupations, suggesting far less has changed since the nineteenth century than we might like to believe. By examining a number of nineteenth-century novels that particularly grapple with issues of desire, eroticism, and consent alongside queer and feminist scholarship, this course will investigate questions of sexual identity, desire, gender conformity, and fluidity, that remain provocative today.\nMelodramatic, sensational, sensual, and challenging, texts like Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White, and Vernon Lee's A Phantom Lover give us the opportunity to reconsider what the Victorians often referred to as \"the Woman Question\": a growing social conservatism in response to changing gender conventions in no way confined to a single sex. How do these narratives negotiate questions of consent and kinship in response to growing calls during the period for gender equality? And what does the Victorian novel have to tell us—\"we other Victorians\"—about ways of thinking about sexual difference, deviance, and desire?"],["Teaching Method","Discussion-based."],["Evaluation Method","Participation, short writing assignments and final essay/project."],["Class Materials (Required)","Texts Include: Emily Bronte, Wuthering Heights; Mary Seacole, The Wonderful Adventures of Mary Seacole in Many Lands; George Eliot, The Lifted Veil; Vernon Lee, A Phantom Lover; Rokeya Hossain, Sultana's Dream; Marghanita Lasky, The Victorian Chaise-Longue."]],"o":"6"}]},{"i":"001834","c":"WCAS","t":"Studies in Postcolonial Literature","u":"ENGLISH","n":"365-0","s":[{"i":"001834-20","r":[{"n":"Kalyan Sunder Sameer Nadiminti"}],"t":"Studies in Postcolonial Literature","k":"Magical Realisms","u":"ENGLISH","n":"365-0","s":"20","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Parkes Hall 214"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":20,"p":[["Overview of class","Novels often describe real and complete worlds that is proximate to our own, with entirely imaginary people going about their daily lives as if in a continuous hut parallel universe.

What kinds of new worlds does this open up and how might it interfere with the conception of literature?Around 1950, Latin American writers began to break away from \"realist\" writing to explore a realm between the real and the magical, giving rise to what is now the established style of \"magical realism.\" To understand this overall movement from realism to magical realism, this course will begin with a consideration of realist writing and its reliance on the simulation of reality, aka verisimilitude, in the first few weeks. After understanding some basic tenets of realism, we will turn to Latin American, South Asian, and American sites of magical realism that stage a revolt against the dictates of the real. We will consider how paying close attention to the deployment of this style can yield significant political interventions, particularly around anti-imperial and anti-racist discourses. Fiction will include texts like Gabriel Garcia Marquez's The Chronicle of a Death Foretold, Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, and Toni Morrison's The Song of Solomon.

Since at least the early 1990s, rapid economic growth, massive infrastructural projects, democratic transformations and global threats of climate change have characterized the South Asian region. Such political, economic, and ecological processes come together to worsen the lives and livelihoods of marginalized people typically. They tend to intensify their vulnerability to environmental degradation, with historical structures of inclusion and exclusion profoundly shaping how natural resources are accessed and distributed.

The class will examine how issues of justice and nature are framed within law and official policy debates, within social movements and right-based struggles, as well as within people's moral imaginations and everyday lives. The following questions will guide the class: •\tWhat environmental problems arose in South Asia through accelerated economic development across the 20th century and early 21st century?\n•\tWho suffered the most, why, and how were they affected, socially, culturally, and materially?\n•\tWhat strategies for justice and sustainability emerged? •\tHow is environmental justice understood across activists, policymakers, and ordinary people whose lives are most in danger?"],["Learning Objectives","1.\tStudents will be able to evaluate processes of economic development, conservation, and natural resource regimes, in terms of their consequences on people who live in places where these processes are received. 2.\tStudents will be able to describe complex social responses to environmental issues such as the rise of environmentalism and protest movements, everyday resistance, local conflicts, and legal disputes, with examples from South Asia. 3.\tStudents will be able to think through key themes in environmental justice such as displacement, dispossession, resource extraction, biodiversity loss, and ecological refugees.

What role does the media play in that crisis? Media production depends upon the expenditure of large amounts of energy and natural resources. Media devices contain toxic materials and take part in a culture of obsolescence that sends increasing amounts of \"high tech trash\" to the landfill. Media content has often developed in close connection to advertising, and so has taken part in the creation of an unsustainable consumer culture. Despite marketing rhetoric that characterizes digital technologies as weightless, virtual, and environmentally clean, there are vast energy, resource, and labor costs that undergird the Internet. At the same time, media communication can function to increase awareness about environmental issues, can substitute for other kinds of high-carbon activities like international travel, can foster understanding of the more-than-human world, and can aid in the fight for environmental justice, as well as a host of other social and cultural benefits. How can we make sense of the complicated equation of environmental cost and benefit in media culture?

The seminar provides the critical tools to analyze current environmental struggles; to understand the controversies within a cultural context; and to make informed decisions about issues that affect us all. The central case study of the seminar will be water and fishing rights for Indigenous Peoples, and how they are part of larger land rights issues. Over the past two decades the issue of tribal sovereignty has become front-page news. From major confrontations over pipelines affecting Tribal Reservations mobilizing Indigenous people and their allies around the world, to battles over whaling rights and mining of tar sands, to sulfide mining adjacent to Tribal Reservations, to disputed land claims in the Northeast and battles in the West over water, fracking, and grazing, the rights of Native governments to exercise their sovereignty remains in the new century at the cultural, political, and legal core of American contemporary history. These and many more issues—air and water quality standards, treaty rights, and land-into-trust—have contributed to tension between Native and non-Native communities, and have become the subject of news reports, in both mainstream and tribal media.

We will engage with local environmental groups and sustainability initiatives, discussing ways in which urban science helps solve the pressing challenges of today to improve life in the future. Lab: In this laboratory section, students will learn experimental design, field methods, and in urban ecology which they will use to conduct a research project in their community. Furthermore, students will participate in urban ecology field trips across Chicago that highlight themes of climate, hydrology, and environmental justice in local communities."],["Teaching Method","This course will include both lecture and active discussion during class times, which will be supplemented with outdoor and field-based experiences during the laboratory section. These outdoor experiences will be a mix of required and optional elements. There will be three external field trips scheduled, and students must participate in two. Students will also design and complete an urban ecology field project, which they will present to the class during a Class Symposium during the final laboratory session."],["Evaluation Method","The evaluation in this course will be based on participation and writing. Students will be expected to participate in class discussions and ask questions during field trips and will receive participation credit accordingly. Students will conduct lab exercise, analyze data, and write results for these activities and will write two longer syntheses of field trip activities (~750 words). The most comprehensive grade elements will be based on students' research projects, which will have conception, data collection & analysis, written paper, peer review, and presentation components. Students will receive ample feedback throughout the term to help them develop scientific writing skills."],["Class Materials (Required)","No required textbook, course materials will be provided.

We will look at ideas concerning fertility, conception, pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, birth control, abortion, and assisted reproduction. Because, at a fundamental level, reproduction is about power - as historian Amy Kaler (but by no means only Kaler), pointed out, \"[c]control over human reproduction is eternally contested, in zones ranging from the comparative privacy of the conjugal bedroom to the political platform and programs of national polities\" - we will pay attention to power in reproductive health. And, since the distribution of power in matters of reproduction has often been uneven and unequal - between men and women, between colonizing and Indigenous populations, between clinicians and lay people, between those in upper socioeconomic classes and those in lower socioeconomic classes - we will pay particular attention during this class to struggles over matters of reproduction as we explore historical changes and continuities in reproduction globally since 1900.

Unfortunately, much of what people learn from pornography doesn't lead them to healthy and satisfying sexual encounters and relationships. This lecture class isn't actually about pornography. It goes beyond many presumptions about sex and pleasure depicted in pornography and popular culture, in order to equip students with information that can lead to more satisfying and healthy sexual experiences across their lifespan, regardless of how they identify, or who or what they like. The course also familiarizes students with a wide spectrum of human identities, practices, and attitudes towards sex and sexuality. Topics covered include: physiological and biological sex; gender; sexual orientation; homophobia and heterosexism; navigating sexual risks in a sex-positive way; sexual health disparities; sexual desire, arousal, and response; solitary sex & sex with others; sex toys; unconventional sexual practices; intimacy and effective communication; sexuality & aging; sexuality, disability & intimacy; sexual problems and solutions; sexual pleasure as part of sexual health; sexual harassment and violence; selling sex; and yes, a brief unit on problematics and possibilities in pornography."],["Class Materials (Required)","All required course materials will be available on Canvas."]]},{"i":"016805-24","r":[{"n":"Beatriz Oralia Reyes","a":"1800 Sherman Suite 1200 #1-108"}],"t":"Special Topics in Global Health","k":"Native Nations, Healthcare Systems, and U.S. Polic","u":"GBL_HLTH","n":"390-0","s":"24","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":17,"m":50}],"l":["University Hall 412"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"SEM","a":20,"p":[["Overview of class","In the territory currently called the United States of America, healthcare for Native populations is often experienced as a tension between settler colonial domination and activism among Native nations to uphold Indigenous sovereignty.

Beginning in the 1990s with the end of the Cold War and the reunification of Berlin, the city quickly became home to cutting-edge DJs, party planners, club owners, and dancers, including notorious clubs like Tresor and Berghain. Coming together, they pioneered new ways to express oneself and connect with one another through music and dance. This course examines many aspects of this culture, from the unique genres of music and how DJs create music to the technology of sound, the experience of dancing and of clubs as spaces, and the politics of belonging, representation, and identity on the dancefloor, in particular its complicated exchanges with Black communities and music in Chicago and Detroit, the birthplaces of this music. We also will consider the social, cultural, and political implications of nightlife and dance music as a site of community-building, friendship, and love within contemporary Western society, especially for queer communities. As our course is a First-Year Seminar, we will discuss various aspects of college academic life. Moreover, our writing assignments will be the core of this course's exploration of dance music and culture. Through our writing, we will learn how to interpret what others have said and made and how to make knowledge ourselves. Each week, we will practice and discuss a specific component of the writing process, from asking good questions to finding sources, synthesizing what others' have said, and constructing arguments. We will hone our skills in crafting college-level writing through summative, comparative, analytic, and research writing assignments as well as practices of revision and editing. There will also be an experiential component to the course involving workshops with DJs in which you will engage in a hands-on approach to topics such as the work of DJing and making music and the politics and logistics of dance."],["Learning Objectives","Understand and practice various forms of analysis and criticism with scholarship and cultural objects across genres, materials, and media.

A large and robust vocabulary is one of the most important indicators of language proficiency in general, and reading proficiency in particular. As a matter of fact, student achievement can be explained as much by vocabulary size as by academic ability, even in the first language. In order for students to advance in their foreign language proficiency to a C1 level on the CEFR scale (or an advanced level on the ACTFL proficiency scale) it is estimated that learners need to acquire at least 1,000 base words per year to reach the 4000-5000 base words necessary for comprehension of authentic sources and literary texts. The goal of this course is to encourage and facilitate the review and acquisition of intermediate- and advanced-level vocabulary items in German through explicit vocabulary instruction which aims at engaging students in actively thinking about word meanings, the relationships among words, and how we can use words in different situations. Short reading, writing, speaking and listing exercises will help students refine vocabulary depth which includes learning about grammar constructions and collocations, connotations, register, and style.

It competes with the more traditional notion of \"alienation\" as a categorization of contemporary life, at least in the \"West\" (or if you prefer \"Global North\"). What is explicit in the German word but not in the English is the reference to the \"home\". What however distinguishes the notion of the Unheimlich from previous theories of alienation or estrangement is that the experience no longer can be framed within the mutually exclusive polarity of domestic vs foreign, since the Unheimlich turns out to be most at home in the home, its strangeness reveals itself to be strangely familiar. Formulated in this way, literature emerges as a privileged medium of the Uncanny. In this course, we will retrace its emergence of a theory of the Uncanny in the texts of Freud and Heidegger, each of which reserve a special place for literature as a privileged setting for this \"apparition\": for Freud the story by E. Th. A. Hoffmann, \"The Sandman;\" for Heidegger Sophocles' tragedy, Antigone. If these ¨classical¨ articulations of the uncanny in literature can be understood as a challenge to traditional Western notions of self-identity, we will look at some responses to this challenge in texts as diverse as The Odyssey (books 23 k& 24), Oedipus at Colonus, several shorter \"stories\" by Kafka (\"Cares of a Housefather,\" \"The Silence of the Sirens\") and finally two \"science fiction\" stories adapted for radio: \"Child's Play\" by William Tenn (1948-51) and Robert A.

His philosophy of technology is not as widely known as the concept of aura he developed in his essay The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility. The contemporary relevance of his philosophy of technology lies in the fact that Benjamin establishes a connection between technology and different forms of habitation, and between the latter and the concept of habit (Gewohnheit), which is etymologically related to the concept of habitation (Wohnen). This enables a comparison of Benjamin's approach with the philosophies of technology developed by Heidegger, Deleuze/Guattari, and Simondon, all of whom associate technology with the shaping of environments and the problem of poesis. In our seminar, we will reconstruct Benjamin's media anthropology of technology through a close reading of his diaries and essays and compare it to philosophies of technology very much being discussed today."]]}]},{"i":"002023","c":"WCAS","t":"Independent Reading","u":"GERMAN","n":"490-0","s":[{"i":"002023-21","t":"Independent Reading","u":"GERMAN","n":"490-0","s":"21","m":[],"x":[],"y":[],"l":[],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"IND","a":5},{"i":"002023-22","t":"Independent Reading","u":"GERMAN","n":"490-0","s":"22","m":[],"x":[],"y":[],"l":[],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"IND","a":5},{"i":"002023-23","t":"Independent Reading","u":"GERMAN","n":"490-0","s":"23","m":[],"x":[],"y":[],"l":[],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"IND","a":5}]},{"i":"003418","c":"WCAS","t":"First-Year Seminar","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"101-6","s":[{"i":"003418-21","r":[{"n":"Enzo Enrique Vasquez Toral"}],"t":"First-Year Seminar","k":"On Drag & Cross-Dressing","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"101-6","s":"21","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":15,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-329"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for First Year & Sophomore only","p":[["Overview of class","Topic: On Drag and Cross-Dressing. From theatrical cross-dressing to drag kings and the queens of Rupaul's Drag Race, crossing gender boundaries through performance has been fundamental in LGBTQI+ culture across time. This course critically explores drag as an art form and platform of expression that unsettles normative gender performance. Drawing from academic fields such as performance studies and queer and trans* studies, this seminar centers the analysis of gender through drag and cross-dressing in different contexts in the Americas by relying on concepts such as performativity, race, gender, class, sexuality, and coloniality. In exploring diverse case studies that call for historical and socio-cultural specificity, students will also analyze drag as a type of political performance and a site of contestation of societal norms. In so doing, we will explore gender as an unstable concept by using examples from theater, dance, TV, film, and popular culture. By the end of the quarter, students will develop skills in academic writing, performance analysis, and interpretation of queer and gender theory. Assignments will include written work that will require students to analyze theoretical, performance, and visual works, peer-review exercises, a creative written piece on a fictional drag persona, and a final research paper that centers a drag figure or practice not covered during the quarter."],["Class Materials (Required)","All course materials will be provided on Canvas."]]},{"i":"003418-22","r":[{"n":"Amy Ruth Partridge","p":"847.491.5872"}],"t":"First-Year Seminar","k":"Coalitional Politics–Case Studies from Chicago and","u":"GNDR_ST","n":"101-6","s":"22","m":["02"],"x":[{"h":12,"m":30}],"y":[{"h":13,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-339"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"LEC","a":14,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for First Year & Sophomore only","p":[["Overview of class","Topic: Coalitional Politics & Case studies from Chicago and beyond: archiving the past for the present In this seminar, we explore several 1970s-era projects in Chicago and beyond that exemplify a coalitional feminist politics and consider the usefulness of this history in an increasingly polarized present.

The aim of this seminar is to introduce students to the history and historiography of race and gender during the Holocaust.

We will read a variety of texts that explore the influences that shaped the behavior and response of an array of people during the Holocaust. Racism sat directly in the center of the Nazi world view. Once the Nazis got into power, they sought to translate ideology into policy. Still, their racial policies evolved over time, spurred by opportunism, innovation, and war. And too, Jewish men and women responded in ways similar and divergent to the Nazi onslaught. Sexism was also seemingly an important aspect of the Nazi perspective.

Issues of health and disease were inextricably entangled with politics during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Scientific recommendations, public health mandates, and the role of institutions from the CDC and the FDA to the WHO were subject to heated debate and partisan politics. Meanwhile, the pandemic also made newly visible and further exacerbated ongoing health disparities within the U.S. and globally. Simultaneously, social movement demands for \"healing justice\" (Black Lives Matter), the \"freedom to thrive\" (BYP 100) and the \"right to live\" (Poor People's Campaign. #FreeThemAll) articulate \"health\" and \"healing\" to projects of collective liberation requiring radical social change, building on (and contributing to) a tradition of radical health activism in the U.S..

Yet stories have always been a way to have a voice, to account for oneself and one's community, and to connect to others who share one's experience.

In this class, we will read literature about medical encounters in order to investigate how ideas about race and gender shape medical experiences. How do these individual accounts reflect larger structural injustices? What kinds of barriers and assumptions do women and people of color face when they receive treatment?

Examining representations of sex and gender in books, manuscripts, maps, printed images, and other textual media from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England, we will ask: how did different communities share ideas about sex?

This course seeks to introduce central, important Hebrew women prose writers and to rethink their place in the historiography of modern Hebrew literature - from Dvora Baron, the first \"mother,\" up to contemporary women writers.

We will use a variety of media, including literature, film, and music, as well as more traditional historical interpretations.

As in many historical contexts, race and gender interacted dynamically and created the particular context of Nazi-occupied Europe, which was a place where Jewish men and women suffered in particular ways, German men and women participated in particular ways, and other racial groups - men and women alike - were targeted, collaborated, resisted and rescued. We will read a variety of texts that explore the influences that shaped the behavior and response of an array of people during the Holocaust. Racism sat directly in the center of the Nazi world view.

The Partition created more than just the two rival nation-states of India and Pakistan from what used to be British India. It also generated a long shadow that continues to define ongoing regional conflicts such as those in Kashmir, continual anxieties about majoritarian and minoritarian identity politics viewed alternately with dread and jubilation in both India and Pakistan, and a persistent desire among South Asian creative artists to make sense of the pain of this violent event. How did the Partition come about? How have scholars, commentators, filmmakers, novelists, creative writers, and those who survived the violence of this event understood and narrativized it? Why does an event that occurred seventy-five years ago loom so large in the collective memory of South Asians today? To address these and other questions, this seminar will be divided into two parts, each based on a selected set of textual and visual materials. Part I will explore the long and complicated historiography of Partition, i.e., how Indian and Pakistani officials, historians, and scholars have written about Partition between the 1950s and contemporary times. Here we will read early accounts explaining how and why the Partition happened, in addition to exploring official narratives of Britain, India, and Pakistan about this event. Part II will focus on how Partition has been remembered beyond scholarly circles by filmmakers, novelists, and documentarians.

While drag now enjoys unprecedented levels of mainstream, commercial success, it once again stands at the heart of polarizing political discourses. With five US states introducing bills to regulate and ban drag, and a growing pattern of armed protests against drag events, one might ask: why do cross-dressing acts elicit such extreme responses, and how did we get here? In this course, we will dive into the tumultuous history of drag as an object of heated public debate in the modern era. We will evaluate the different ways in which states, communities, and people responded to drag in different temporal and national contexts, with a focus on Europe and North America. What do these debates teach us about how norms of citizenship, morality, gender, and sexuality were negotiated on and off the stage? What distinguishes drag as an art form, and when and how did it truly begin? Is drag inherently liberatory, radical, and progressive, or actually conformist, oppressive, and misogynist? What is the relationship between drag and social movements? How did the World Wars transform and revolutionize drag? And what do queens and kings have to do with any of this? Using primary and secondary sources, including memoirs, documentaries, and memorabilia, we will explore the significance of drag as an art form and a political subculture."],["Learning Objectives","By the end of this course, students will be able to explain key concepts in the history of gender and sexuality, gain skills of historical thinking and argumentation, interpret primary sources in their historical context, and think critically about uses of the past in current cultural and political debates."],["Evaluation Method","Class participation, reading response papers, and final writing project."],["Class Materials (Required)","All the assigned readings will be uploaded on Canvas"],["Class Notes","Concentration: Americas, European"]],"o":"4"}]},{"i":"002149","c":"WCAS","t":"Research Seminar","u":"HISTORY","n":"395-0","s":[{"i":"002149-20","r":[{"n":"Melissa A Macauley","p":"847/491-3418","a":"Harris Hall - Room 344"}],"t":"Research Seminar","k":"Imperialism in Asia","u":"HISTORY","n":"395-0","s":"20","m":["2"],"x":[{"h":16,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":18,"m":50}],"l":["Kresge Centennial Hall 2-319"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"SEM","a":15,"q":"Enrollment Requirements: Freshmen may not register for this course.","p":[["Overview of class","The history of \"imperialism in Asia\" is a global history. It involved virtually all of the European colonial powers: Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Germany and, of course, Great Britain. The United States joined the club in the nineteenth century and, unlike the rest of the colonized world, a non-Western nation, Japan, participated in this tradition of territorial conquest and cultural hegemony. Paradoxically, the Japanese simultaneously intensified the colonial experience and, by starting the war in the Pacific, inaugurated the process that led to decolonization and the emergence of independent nation states. This seminar will explore this history in its multifaceted dimensions, and students interested in Asian, European, American, and Global history are all welcome. The initial two-thirds of the seminar will be devoted to reading primary and secondary sources relating to colonialism and imperialism in East, Southeast, and South Asia. Naturally we will not be able to explore the topic in all its dimensions in just a few weeks, but we will learn from each other. The latter third of the course will be devoted to the research and writing of a term paper on any topic of your choice relating to the history of imperialism in these regions, whether from the historical perspective of the perpetrators or the victims.

Since at least the early 1990s, rapid economic growth, massive infrastructural projects, democratic transformations and global threats of climate change, have characterized the South Asian region. Such political, economic, and ecological processes come together to worsen the lives and livelihoods of marginalized people typically. They tend to intensify their vulnerability to environmental degradation, with historical structures of inclusion and exclusion profoundly shaping how natural resources are accessed and distributed. While the regional focus is on South Asia, at the heart of this course is a broader concern that environmental questions are always questions of equality and social justice. The class will examine how issues of justice and nature are framed within law and official policy debates, within social movements and right-based struggles, as well as within people's moral imaginations and everyday lives. The following questions will guide the class: What environmental problems arose in South Asia through accelerated economic development across the 20th century and early 21st century? Who suffered the most, why, and how were they affected, socially, culturally, and materially? What strategies for justice and sustainability emerged? How is environmental justice understood across activists, policymakers, and ordinary people whose lives are most in danger?"],["Learning Objectives","1.\tStudents will be able to evaluate processes of economic development, conservation, and natural resource regimes, in terms of their consequences on people who live in places where these processes are received. 2.\tStudents will be able to describe complex social responses to environmental issues such as the rise of environmentalism and protest movements, everyday resistance, local conflicts, and legal disputes, with examples from South Asia. 3.\tStudents will be able to think through key themes in environmental justice such as displacement, dispossession, resource extraction, biodiversity loss, and ecological refugees. You will also be able to understand and explain positive values such as quality of life, rights-based conservation, local meanings of place, and intimate attachments with a world of human-non-human entanglements. You will be able to identify how and when these themes generate controversy and provide examples. 4.\tStudents will learn to examine historical and ethnographic sources, policy documents, and scientific reports, and use them to think about environmental issues in multi-dimensional ways.

It also generated a long shadow that continues to define ongoing regional conflicts such as those in Kashmir, continual anxieties about majoritarian and minoritarian identity politics viewed alternately with dread and jubilation in both India and Pakistan, and a persistent desire among South Asian creative artists to make sense of the pain of this violent event. How did the Partition come about? How have scholars, commentators, filmmakers, novelists, creative writers, and those who survived the violence of this event understood and narrativized it? Why does an event that occurred seventy-five years ago loom so large in the collective memory of South Asians today? To address these and other questions, this seminar will be divided into two parts, each based on a selected set of textual and visual materials. Part I will explore the long and complicated historiography of Partition, i.e., how Indian and Pakistani officials, historians, and scholars have written about Partition between the 1950s and contemporary times. Here we will read early accounts explaining how and why the Partition happened, in addition to exploring official narratives of Britain, India, and Pakistan about this event.

Thus, in analyzing written and visual cultural practices that revisit the figure of the criminal, this course will explore topics such as the relationship between legal order and violence, criminality and popular justice, as well as of the (out)law and civil society. Primary readings for this course will include works from Roberto Bolaño, J. L.

This course examines how aesthetic expressions and practices such as urban design and architecture, public art and graffiti, and public performances shape struggles over rights to the city. For example, we will learn how Indigenous migrants from Latin America paint murals to challenge anti-Indigenous racism and erasure in Los Angeles and how urban developers in Delhi use aesthetic judgments of the working poor to justify their forced removal from public spaces. While aesthetics are commonly associated with the visual qualities of people and things, this course will also explore multi-sensory aesthetic experiences and judgments, such as noise control initiatives in Tapei and the racial politics of smell in New York City. Students will have the opportunity to develop arts and media-based final projects that examine urban aesthetics through methods that include but are not limited to sound/smell maps, comics, podcast episodes, performances, or art installations.

through performance. Rather than disentangle experiences and representations of gender, race, and sexuality to focus on one category over the others, our analysis will bring these categories to bear on one another as we work to theorize how bodies accrue social meaning that objectifies, stereotypes, appropriates, and maybe even empowers or liberates human subjects to challenge sexism, transphobia, racism, and homophobia. Performance studies is an interdisciplinary field animated by the insights and methods of many disciplines such as theatre studies, anthropology, literary studies, sociology, political science, philosophy, and several others. As a result, it will likely resonate with students in any academic discipline, and no experience with performance is necessary. The course is primarily a seminar-style discussion. By the end of the term, students will have produced an original research project that analyzes some aspect of performance alongside topics of gender, race, and/or sexuality that have a global significance."]]},{"i":"016391-21","r":[{"n":"Diana Kathleen Elhard"}],"t":"Integrating Project Seminar","k":"International Climate Change Politics & Policy","u":"INTL_ST","n":"395-0","s":"21","m":["13"],"x":[{"h":11,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":12,"m":20}],"l":["Annenberg Hall G29"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"SEM","a":6,"p":[["Overview of class","International climate change impacts all of us and in many spaces doom and gloom is the dominant narrative.

Strictly speaking, until the first half of the 20th century, it is difficult to talk about a fashion which is essentially Italian rather than the execution of French-inspired models. It was only starting from the 1950s, with the fashion shows in Sala Bianca in Florence, that Italian fashion was established at the international level. The Fifties were also the decade of the Italian economic miracle, which constitutes both the presupposition and the consequence of a growth in American interest in Italian fashion. In the eighties Italy established fashion as a language of mass culture with the invention of a new prêt-à-porter - or \"ready to wear\": a kind of style attractive from an aesthetic point of view and independent from high fashion and from France stylistically and structurally. At the beginning of the 21st century, Italian fashion collects heritage of craftsmanship, taste for beauty, attention to the manufacture of the product, organizational capacity, and production quality, but above all, it launches new ways of representing, selling and communicating the product. The course will start with an introduction to the birth of modern fashion in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century and will then focus on the birth and the development of Italian fashion from 1920 up to 2000, always comparing it with other western fashion styles in France, in the United Kingdom and in the U.S.A.

Using primary historical sources, we will analyze the myriad ways in which Jews and Arabs formed personal and even romantic relationships in the background of the escalating national struggle"],["Learning Objectives","• To increase the understanding of the complex and multifaceted relationship between the Jewish and Arab communities. • To shape an informed historical opinion upon a contested historical period and encourage critical thinking in relations to it.\n• To familiarize with recent scholarly developments, methods, and approaches in the historiography of Jewish-Arab relations in Palestine/The Land of Israel. • To encourage active participation in class discussions and in critical evaluation of primary and secondary sources."],["Evaluation Method","Class participation: 15%\nDiscussion posts: 15%\nMidterm paper: 30%\nResearch Project: 40%"],["Class Materials (Required)","Materials will be provided by the instructor."]],"o":"4"}]},{"i":"023126","c":"WCAS","t":"Topics in Israel Studies","u":"JWSH_ST","n":"280-6","s":[{"i":"023126-1","r":[{"n":"Hanna Tzuker Seltzer","p":"847/467-5684","a":"Crowe 5-159","o":"Mondays/Wednesdays 11:00 - 12:00","b":"Hanna Seltzer was born and raised in Jerusalem.

In a society where many feel themselves as outsiders, what does Otherness actually mean? Is it a subjective stance or a definite (and \"objective\") position? Does Otherness exist only when juxtaposed with what is supposedly the social norms of \"Israeli society\" or can it stand by itself? Does Israeli society is othering others to have a false sense of unity? And is there an actual entity of \"Israeli society\" or is it only imagined by those who seek to be part of it? Film in its nature is an introspective tool, and in the case of Israeli film it has always been a prism through which Israeli directors examine questions of identity, the treatment of \"others\", and the relationship between the center and the margins. In this class we will watch various Israeli films that relate to the notion of otherness and to the dilemmas that arise from the characters' complex position in Israeli society. Among the movies we will watch are \"Noodle\", \"Borrowed Identity\", \"Sandstorm\" and \"Baba Joon\". We will read texts that will contextualize the movies and will shed light on the stance of otherness in Israeli society. No previous knowledge of Hebrew or Israel or Israeli cinema is required.

You will build upon this foundation for the remainder of the course by researching two asylum claims involving refugees from two countries, which you will present in mock hearings at the end of the course. The class will divide into two groups. Group 1 will present a claim involving their client and Group 2 will serve as the USCIS trial attorney or opposing counsel. Group 2 will then present a claim involving their client with Group 1 serving as the USCIS trial attorney or opposing counsel. Throughout the course, you will be given assignments that relate to the presentation of your cases. You also will be given opportunities to discuss questions emerging from your research for your cases with guest speakers who are experts in specific areas relating to refugees or asylum law. It is anticipated that in the latter part of the course, we will meet with a judge and prosecutor to learn more about their professions and to give you an opportunity to ask questions relating to case procedure. In the eighth and ninth weeks of the quarter, you will represent your applicant's claim in front of a judge, with your classmates performing the roles of asylum applicant, and expert and lay witnesses, including family and community members."],["Class Materials (Required)","Access to AILA Asylum Primer 8th Edition.\nCost is $75 for 6 month subscription.

In carrying out this study, we plumb the linguist's toolkit (which includes tools borrowed from mathematics, logic, language acquisition, and experimental psychology) to discover how language scientists determine what a given word or sentence means, and whether that word or sentence means the same thing across occasions of use. This inquiry will lead the student to an understanding of the scientific study of language, by examining how it plays out in the domain of linguistic meaning.

They don't look like much, but the first one contains all of the content of Green's theorem, the Divergence Theorem, and Stokes's theorem from multivariable calculus, together with their vast generalization to higher dimensions as described by Élie Cartan in 1945. The pair of equations below it is a modern formulation of Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, which led Maxwell to realize in 1861 that light is an electromagnetic wave. These powerful equations are very short! This is because the notation of differential forms provides a compact way both to reformulate and to properly understand the geometry of integration and vector calculus in any number of dimensions. It is crucial to understanding modern geometry and high-energy physics. Studying equations with differential forms also leads to powerful tools in the field of topology: you can use them to tell the difference between different higher-dimensional analogues of surfaces (\"manifolds\").

To respond to these questions, the seminar brings together cultural products and critical texts across time, languages, and geographies. Ultimately, our objective is to think critically about how care is culturally constructed and represented."]]},{"i":"021038-23","r":[{"n":"Brannon Dobbs Ingram","a":"Crowe Hall 4-135"}],"t":"Seminar in Middle East and North African Studies","k":"Islam & Colonialism","u":"MENA","n":"301-3","s":"23","m":["1"],"x":[{"h":14,"m":0}],"y":[{"h":16,"m":30}],"l":["University Hall 118"],"d":"2023-03-28","e":"2023-06-03","c":"SEM","a":5,"p":[["Overview of class","Course title: Islam & Colonialism/Religion & Politics in Islam This course examines the effects of colonialism on Islam and the effects of Islam on colonialism.

It begins with the concept of \"Orientalism\" and how Orientalist representations of Islam fueled Europe's \"civilizing mission.\" It then considers colonialism's impact on multiple dimensions of Islam and Muslim societies, including (but not limited to) Islamic law, Muslim worship and ritual life, forms and systems of knowledge, and the status of women.

This course explores the diversity of the contemporary political experiences of Muslims in multiple and shifting contexts to address questions such as: what is the role of ideology and faith in Muslim politics? Where does political Islam come from? How does politics play out in the lives of Muslims? How diverse are contemporary political experiences of Muslims? How did immigration, globalization, Islamic revival and violent extremism and securitization policies reshape the political and religious landscape of Muslim-majority nations as well as in non-Muslim countries? What does the study of political Islam teach us about the relationship between religious and politics in the modern world? The course is divided in three parts. In Part 1, we focus on the politics of Islamic revival through the trajectories of various Islamic political movements in the Middle East, Asia and Africa to understand the origins of the rise of political Islam and its national, regional and global impact. In Part 2, we turn to transnational Muslim networks and connections to explore the main issues around global political Islam in its various forms including violent Islamic extremism, Sufism, piety movements, economic networks. We discuss also anti-Muslim violence and its origins. In Part 3, we examine the social, political and historical dynamics shaping the politics of Muslim minorities in Europe and the USA, including the war on terror, identity politics, racialization and islamophobia. Our cross-cutting themes include state in the Muslim world, party politics, secularism, democracy, social movements, political violence, the politics of religion, security policies, globalization, citizenship, social and economic development… Our readings are drawn from political science, religious studies and anthropology."],["Class Materials (Required)","1.

As the Industrial Revolution rapidly reshaped the world's material and social relations, popular revolutions erupted to overthrow corrupt ruling classes and experiment with new forms of political and social organization. Some of these revolutions are well-known, such as the French Revolution (1789) and the Russian Revolution (1917); others deserve more attention, such as the Ottoman Constitutional Revolution (1908). At the same time, the nineteenth century witnessed the massive expansion of European imperialism in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, igniting numerous anti-colonial revolutions, including the Haitian Revolution (1791) and the Indian Rebellion (1857). These revolutions posed a direct challenge to \"modern\" Europe and its supposedly liberal values. Moving between these diverse political and cultural contexts, this course investigates art's role in representing revolutionary ideals and producing new kinds of political subjects in the nineteenth century. This course takes a global frame that centers capitalism, interimperial competition, race, and gender as the primary forces that drove revolutionary art-making throughout the world. Instead of a broad survey, this course closely analyzes individual artworks in a wide range of media, including painting, sculpture, drawing, prints, photography, and political cartoons."],["Teaching Method","Lecture\nReadings\nClass participation"],["Evaluation Method","Attendance\nClass participation\nReadings\nWriting assignments"],["Class Materials (Required)","Course readings will be available on Canvas."]],"o":"6"},{"i":"020942-2","r":[{"n":"Nasrin Qader","p":"847/491-8263","a":"1860 S.

Ethical and Evaluative Thinking: • Attain the conceptual tools needed to recognize and understand prescriptive issues, questions and claims, and to distinguish them from descriptive issues, questions, and claims: we will examine how evaluative claims (e.g., the perfection of God) were often used to underpin descriptive claims about the nature of the universe and the human mind. • Identify the values presupposed by an outlook or discourse: we will examine some of the central developments in early modern philosophy, as religious points of view gave rise to, as well as conflicted with, the emerging scientific perspective. • Recognize the complexity of many ethical issues and consider a variety of alternative resolutions and the reasons for holding them: we will look at a variety of ethical and evaluative issues (e.g., the problem of evil, the case for religious toleration, and the ethical foundations of personal identity), as well as their impact on broader philosophical systems. • Appreciate the insights available in one or more intellectual or cultural traditions: we will look at the intersections and divergences between various intellectual and cultural traditions, including the Reformation, the rise of early modern science, and the emergence of secularism in the Enlightenment; we will also look at how these developments appear from the point of view of some non-European philosophers. • Reflect upon one's own answers to evaluative questions, the presuppositions informing them, and the reasons supporting them: we will develop our own interpretations of, and responses to, the early modern philosophers we read, and we will develop our own views about the issues they consider, while uncovering the ways in which our presuppositions may differ from theirs. • Engage in respectful, rigorous, and constructive dialogue concerning evaluative issues and communicate thoughtfully and clearly about them: we will engage in a variety of individual and group activities that will foster a capacity for critical, charitable discussion, both verbally and in writing."],["Class Materials (Required)","Class materials must be purchased.

In the first part of the course, we will explore the problem of \"moral standing:\" the problem of who or what is deserving of ultimate moral consideration. For example, do sentient non-human animals like pigs or polar bears have moral standing? What about non-sentient life, such as plants or fungus? Might whole ecosystems or even nature as such have moral standards? We will examine recent arguments on these questions and their implications for moral theory. In the second part of the course, we will turn directly to the issue of global climate change. We will explore the standard economic analysis of climate change as a collective action problem and the philosophical presuppositions of that analysis. We will consider the question of the fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of climate mitigation globally, and we will discuss the ethics of geoengineering. We will close by considering the issue of \"anthropocentrism\" in ethics, asking whether and why anthropocentrism might be a problem for moral theory."],["Learning Objectives","(1) Recognize moral issues and distinguish them from descriptive ones.

(5) Understand the differential impacts of anthropogenic climate change globally, and explore the intersection between climate justice and historical injustices.

and Penelope Deutsher, 2022-2023) A revolutionary, thinker, psychiatrist, and physician, Frantz Fanon (1925-1961) produced a diverse and groundbreaking life work from Martinique to Algeria that has shaped generations of activists and scholars, and continues to do so. This graduate seminar will examine early and late major writings of Fanon, and a selection of scholarship on and influenced by Fanon in the fields of critical race theory, feminist theory, and decolonial thought, such as Gordon, Karera, Maldonado-Torres, Zambrana, Mbembe, Al-Saji, Snorton, and Wynter, among others. The range and nature of responses to Fanon's work since his time speaks to the continued problem of colonialism, anti-Blackness, and the racialized gender system, as well as the changes in paradigms and discourse surrounding these issues. The course encourages seminar participants to think critically with and about Fanon's work, to incorporate Fanon into their research and explore the renewed significance of Fanon's work today. Prospective participants should write Professor We and Professor Deutscher jointly. The course prerequisites are: least one course (or equivalent) in Black/Critical Race Theory or decolonial thought, and one course ((or equivalent) in gender and sexuality studies."],["Registration Requirements","Prospective participants should write Professor We and Professor Deutscher jointly.

Heterogeneous architectures combine CPUs with additional hardware accelerators, the most familiar of which is perhaps the general purpose GPU. A less familiar but often more powerful alternative is the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), which can provide reduced latency, higher throughput, greater flexibility, and significant power savings. In this course we will consider Monte Carlo integration as a case study for an exploring heterogeneous computing with FPGAs. Students should have a working knowledge of basic C/C++. We will briefly review the relevant aspects of the language(s) at the beginning of the course, but students will greatly benefit from having had a more formal, earlier introduction. No specific C/C++ textbook is required. Some prior exposure to introductory statistics and experience with Unix/Linux operating systems will be helpful, although this is also not required."]]}]},{"i":"002732","c":"WCAS","t":"Independent

How does \"globalization\" affect these chances? These are some of the questions that we will explore in this class. The goal of the seminar is to enhance our understanding of differences in levels of development among countries of the world, and to explore competing hypotheses designed to explain those differences. We will examine both the contemporary global economy and the historical processes that brought the current situation into being."],["Class Materials (Required)","The assigned readings come from the following sources:\n1.\tA Course Reader.

Some of the topics it covers include: what is the law, and why people obey it; the relationship between law and social change; crime, the police, and the prison crisis in America; how people get a lawyer and how lawyers make a living; civil justice and the litigation explosion; courts, judges, politics and corruption; Supreme Court decision making; and legal strategies for making change."],["Learning Objectives","a) To learn basic process by which courts decide civil and criminal cases by participating in a mock trial as a lawyer, witness, or juror. Students should be able, in section, to discuss the relationship between process and outcome and analyze assumptions in the legal system with respect to human capacity and behavior. Discuss important concepts such as bias and discrimination and how they can arise from institutional factors as well as bureaucratic discretion. b) Learn basic process of making, enforcing, and interpreting the law by legislatures, executives, and courts. Students should know the names and roles of actors in the legal system, from judges, to mayors, to prosecutors, to sheriffs, to police. c) The students should be able to discuss important American politics concepts such as democratic accountability (whether citizens are able to hold legal actors accountable for their behavior and whether citizens should have this power), the rule of law (and its importance for legitimacy and obedience), and rational choice (which structures the behavior of actors in the system such as judges, members of congress, and voters). d) The course is designed to give students with a general interest in law or criminal justice a feel for how political scientists study these topics."],["Teaching Method","Lecture and discussion sections"],["Evaluation Method","Participation in discussion section, midterm exam, and final exams"],["Class Materials (Required)","Baum, Lawrence.

Because IR is an interdisciplinary field, we will benefit from diverse fields such as political sciences, history, economics, international law, philosophy, and sociology. With the conceptual help of these fields, we will explore issues like state sovereignty, globalization, ecological sustainability, economic development, nationalism, international security, nuclear proliferation, and human rights. The design of this class aims to apply international relations theories to the actors, interests, and ideas that shape global politics. The trick with a survey core course is to find a balance between ‘classic' texts and current events. Thus, this class will provide you both a strong foundation for understanding international politics and skills to apply that foundation to common international politics issues. With readings on topics such as colonialism, lived experience during war, impacts of international organizations and law, ways of exercising state sovereignty, etc., the course is especially attentive to the centrality of race, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic class, and nationality to global interactions."],["Learning Objectives","The main goal of this course is to equip you with many theoretical tools to make sense of the complex relationships, power dynamics, and interests of international actors that are embedded in international politics. With a historical background, we will discuss the evolutions of our understanding of international politics, and thus contextualize the current issues within their own historic process. At the end of this course, you will 1. Understand the major concepts of international relations, including: power, the international system, balance of power, hegemony, conflict, security, cooperation, competition, globalization, dependence, equality, justice, sustainability, international political economy. 2. Critically evaluate and apply the theories and approaches to international relations, including realism, liberalism, classical and neo-Marxism, post-modernist, post-colonial, and feminist to transnational issues. 3. Identify the key actors in international politics—including states, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, transnational corporations, global civil society, and individuals—and analyze how these actors' interests, ideas, and identities interact with structures to shape international politics. 4. Demonstrate a knowledge of the key dimensions, events and processes of international relations within their historic context, such as: the formation of the modern state system, the Treaty of Westphalia, the evolution of global capitalism, colonialism, the origins of the Cold War, the shift to the post-Cold War system, the role of race, gender and class in the structure of the modern world system, major conflicts, such as the world wars, U. S. intervention in various places in the world, ascendant conflicts, the features and effects of globalizing market capitalism, growing environmental problems, and human rights. 5. Demonstrate skills of critical analysis and written and oral communication, including the ability to: a. Read and reflect on disciplinary materials and literature carefully, critically, and insightfully; b. Write well-organized, informed, logically argued, clear, persuasive, and stylistically correct essays and papers; c.

The theoretical frameworks of Walter Benjamin, Friedrich Hayek, Franz Kafka, Carl Schmitt, Hans Kelsen, H.L.A.

By the 1970s wars within states, referred to in this class as civil wars, had become the world's dominant form of warfare. These conflicts are notable for their intensities and their durations. Elements of civil wars also appeared in inter-state wars, such as after the American-led attack on Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq in 2003 and against the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. These wars have involved armed struggles between state forces and rebels over the control of territory and the right to form the central government. But armed actors in civil wars reflect many agendas and include ethnic militias, vigilante groups, foreign mercenaries, and criminal gangs. A key observation in this course, however, is that these multiple agendas and complex dynamics¿\"wars within wars\"¿play more important roles in recent and ongoing civil wars. This development stands in contrast to civil wars through the mid-20th century. Though these wars also included complex arrays of armed groups and agenda, they tended to feature more clear-cut distinctions between state and rebel combatants. The causes and significance of this change will constitute one of the themes of this course.\nThe first segment of this course will consider several academic theories about the causes of civil wars. These theories range from the economist's analysis that an abundance of natural resources and other economic opportunities provide incentives for rebellion to enterprising individuals, to the idea derived from international relations that \"security dilemmas\" (mutual fears that one's neighbors are preparing to strike) cause civil wars, and to the investigation of how changes in the global structure of economies and politics are at the roots of many civil wars. The second segment of this course will focus on the processes of war fighting in civil wars. Students will find that the explanations of causes of civil wars, while of varying applicability from one case to the next, prove to be quite valuable in terms of generating questions and in turning attention to particular kinds of relationships. This section will focus on processes such as the rise of leaders, the formulation of ideologies and political programs (or their absence), and recruitment of fighters and supporters. In a third section we will consider the special role of violence in influencing the courses of these other processes and relationships."],["Learning Objectives","1.

What compromises, if any, are appropriate when considering kleptocrats who are effectively holding their people hostage - for instance, rulers who systematically abuse loans from foreign creditors, but who rely on the fact that their vulnerable population will suffer if loans are cut off entirely? What compromises, if any, are morally appropriate when dealing with dictators who threaten to unleash violence unless they are guaranteed an amnesty by the democratic forces trying to replace them? This upper-level course delves into such fraught political problems, revolving around different kinds of corruption and abuse of political power. In order to grapple with these problems, we examine in detail two moral ideas related to \"the people.\" The first is the idea of the sovereign people as the owner of public property, often stolen by corrupt politicians. The second is the idea of the people as an agent with its own moral integrity - an integrity that might bear on intricate policy dilemmas surrounding the proper response to corruption. In the process of examining both of these ideas, students will acquire familiarity with prominent philosophical treatments of integrity, property, and - more generally - public policy."],["Registration Requirements","This course is open to undergraduate and graduate students.

In Part 1, we focus on the politics of Islamic revival through the trajectories of various Islamic political movements in the Middle East, Asia and Africa to understand the origins of the rise of political Islam and its national, regional and global impact. In Part 2, we turn to transnational Muslim networks and connections to explore the main issues around global political Islam in its various forms including violent Islamic extremism, Sufism, piety movements, economic networks. We discuss also anti-Muslim violence and its origins. In Part 3, we examine the social, political and historical dynamics shaping the politics of Muslim minorities in Europe and the USA, including the war on terror, identity politics, racialization and islamophobia.

Why do people have these beliefs? We'll look at \"weird\" beliefs within our culture and maybe some cross-cultural examples to understand the social and cognitive processes that lead to development and maintenance of beliefs. Among the specific topics we may cover are: distinction between science and pseudoscience, science denial, superstition, parapsychology, conspiracy theories, ghosts, near-death and out-of-body experiences, witchcraft, alien abduction, and repressed memories of abuse. Since this is an upper-level research course, we will focus on psychological theories, methodological issues, and empirical research in this area. We'll do some hands-on research and data interpretation activities during class meetings. Students will work in groups to design, conduct, analyze, and write up an empirical research project during the quarter."],["Registration Requirements","Prerequisite: Students must complete Psych 205 before taking this course."],["Teaching Method","Primarily discussion, hands-on research and data analysis activities, videos, and some brief lectures."],["Evaluation Method","Grades will be based on weekly written discussion questions, finding and summarizing empirical research articles, participation in class discussion, contributions to class data collection, a group presentation, and an empirical research project conducted in small groups."],["Class Materials (Required)","In addition to the required books (tentative list below), we will have articles and chapters from a variety of other sources that will be available through the Canvas course management system.

In the last two decades, interest in spatial cognition has increased substantially, and this course is designed to provide an overview of these developments. The class is relevant to psychology, education, communication, and many other disciplines. All graduate students are welcome to register for the course; advanced undergraduates will be considered based on discussion with the Professor. Topics to be covered include the following: What mental representations support navigation in humans and non-humans, and how might these vary across cultures. How does gender relate to spatial thinking (and we will read and discuss a newly published feminist theory on this issue)? How does spatial thinking develop in children? How and why does spatial thinking relate to interest and performance in different topics, such as science, mathematics, engineering, and building trades?

We will look at such areas as: how religion gets mediated; the religious dimensions of transmedia storytelling and media world-building; religion as communication; online group identity formation and religious identity construction; media representation of religions; the blurred boundaries between the so-called \"sacred and the secular\" in the study of religion and media; and controversies in overlapping religious worlds and media worlds vis-à-vis the authorized and unauthorized circulation of content. Of particular interest in this course will be the impact of digital culture on the media-religion interface. Students will be asked to research and analyze a primary source of their choice and then to make their own media to communicate their original analysis and research findings. This course will involve your own creative mediamaking. Please note format: This course is a mixture of lecture and in-class participatory discussion.

Analyzing a variety of works of media addressing environmental themes, including works drawn from advertising and marketing, we will consider different types of environmental messaging and attempts to mobilize public moral engagement. Specifically, we will be looking at strategies for implementing media interventions as moral interventions. Discussion taken up in this class will include evaluating the comparative value of media messaging that emphasizes individual action and personal responsibility, versus messaging that promotes collective action, policy, and structural changes. Students will consider and debate what constitutes authentic \"green\" messaging versus mere corporate \"greenwashing.\" Throughout, we will ask what kind of media we need in what has been called the \"Anthropocene\" (a time when humans are now a major geologic force affecting the future of the planet). When motivating public moral engagement in climate crisis, are the solutions being offered those that the planet will actually \"register\" or \"notice\" on a global scale? If not, what kinds of \"media interventions\" do we need to be making and how?

In the immediate aftermath, U.S. policy makers were faced with not one but four nuclear powers (Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus), thousands of under-secured nuclear weapons and under-paid nuclear scientists, and several armed secessionist conflicts in the Caucasus and Moldova. The collapse of the USSR meant the end of an uneasy, but by and large consensual, international security system. Russia has shown a willingness to reject that consensus. It has rejected Western support for the democratic aspirations of former Soviet states, willing even to use military force to deny countries like Ukraine and Georgia their sovereign rights to join NATO and the EU.

Through sociological analysis, we can answer questions like: How did Evanston become largely segregated by race? Why is it illegal for people to sell their kidneys? Is suicide contagious? Why would someone pay for Instagram followers? Sociology is a huge field of study, and includes an enormous variety of topics and methods. Each week, we will focus on a specific area of sociological study (Culture, Gender, Race, Family, Money, Deviance, etc.) with the goal of offering you a general overview of the types of questions sociologists ask and how they answer them.

But in the streets, you have soccer, samba, and Portuguese. After a while you feel like a centaur.\" Scliar's fictional explorations of Jewish identity have led the literary scholar Nelson Vieira to observe that the Brazilian writer's stories \"are reminiscent of work by Canadian-Jewish writer Mordecai Richler and the American novelist Philip Roth, both of whom struggle to capture the perplexing and exasperating paradoxes of people who live between two worlds.\" This course will take Vieira's remark as a critical point of departure to read contemporary Jewish literature of the Americas comparatively. Building on critical/theoretical readings, we will explore selected post-WWII novels and short stories published by Jewish writers across North and South America. While such fiction is often framed solely as part of a national tradition, we will look beyond national borders to understand some of the convergences and divergences of Jewish literary discourses which have emerged in different national contexts of the Western Hemisphere. Over the term, we will examine ways in which modern and contemporary Jewish fiction writers have approached themes of religion, culture, assimilation, diaspora, race, gender, sexuality, the legacy of the Holocaust, and other key concerns.

This course will introduce more machine learning models (SVMs, MARs, ensembles, etc), deepen predictive modeling skills (feature engineering, model assessment and evaluation, etc), and survey topics such as unsupervised learning and version control. While many data science problems will require knowledge of multiple coding languages and technologies, this course chooses to utilize R through the IDE RStudio to conduct data science. Students will develop and extend skills, tools, and strategies for modeling and understanding complex data.
